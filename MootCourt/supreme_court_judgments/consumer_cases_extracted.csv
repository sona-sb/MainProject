JUDGMENT
 Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. 
1. This is an appeal by the defendant against the decree of the High Court of Nagpur which reversed
the decree of the Additional District Judge, Khamgaon, dismissing the plaintiff's suit. Leave to
appeal was granted as the value of the subject-matter of the suit in the trial Court was Rs. 35,000
and as there were substantial questions of law.
2. The property involved is a Ginning and a Pressing factory situated at Khamgaon and the case for
the plaintiff is that they belonged originally to Sir Hukumchand and his son Rajkumarsing from
whom he purchased the factories for a sum of Rs. 35,000 under a registered sale deed, dated
26-11-1939. Prior to the sale, there was a letter or note on 3-11-1939, setting out the agreement
between the parties relating to the sale. On the next day, possession of the factories was handed over
to one Seth Chapsi Dhanji at Khamgaon on behalf of the plaintiff. Two days afterwards, i. e. on the
6th of November, Sir Hukumchand entered into a fresh agreement to sell with the defendant, but
this was behind the back of the plaintiff. On the 7th of November, the defendant's men attempted to
take forcible possession of the factories from Chapsi Dhanji, plaintiff's representative on the
premises.
Ultimately, the defendant's agent one Nathmal resorted t"

1. These five appeals pursuant to special leave are directed against the order of the Income-tax
Appellate Tribunal by which five appeals before it, two in regard to income-tax assessment for
1947-48 and 1948-49 and the other three against business profits tax assessment for the three
chargeable accounting periods covered by the same accounting periods, were disposed of. By the
Income-tax Officer and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the matter was decided in the
income-tax assessment appeal relating to the year of assessment 1947-48. The question in all these
appeals is common and it relates to depreciation under section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act

2. The appellant is the corporation of the City of Nagpur constituted under the City of Nagpur

was delivered by SHAH, J. :
SHAH, J. - In these six appeals, the constitutional validity of section 2(g) of the Bihar
Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act XIX of 1947), as amended by the Bihar Sales Tax
(Amendment) Act, 1949 (Act VI of 1949), is challenged.
To appreciate the grounds on which the contention is raised by the appellants, it is
necessary to set out the legislative provisions applicable to the sales in respect of
which tax was sought to be levied by the State of Bihar under the Bihar Sales Tax Act,
1947. In exercise of the legislative power conferred by entry 48 in List II of the
Government of India Act, 1935, the Legislature of the Province of Bihar enacted the
Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act XIX of 1947, which was brought into operation on July
1, 1947. The Act was amended by the Bihar Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1949 (Act of

These two appeals on a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution have been filed

1. This is a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution for the issue of a wait of mandamus or a writ in
the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate direction, order or writ to direct the respondent,
the Union of India, to the withdraw or cancel the notification dated August 31, 1957, recognising
""the Stock Exchanges, Bombay"" under section 4 of the securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956
(XLII of 1956), (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"").
2. At the outset it is necessary to notice briefly how a stock Exchange is worked and how it is
controlled or regulated by the State. ""Stock Exchange"" means, ""any body of individuals, whether
incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting or controlling the business of buying,
selling or deal in securities"". The history of stock exchanges in foreign countries as well as India
shows that the development of joint stock enterprise would never have reached its present stage but
for the facilities which the stock exchanges provided for dealing in securities. They have a very
important function to fulfil in the country's economy. Their main function, in the words of an
eminent writer, is ""to liquify capital by enabling a person who has invested money in, say, a factory

1. The facts giving rise to this appeal, by special leave, are these :
The Dominion of India, as the owner of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway,
represented by the General Manager of that railway, invited tenders for the supply of
jaggery to the railway grain shops. The respondent submitted his tender for the
supply of 14,000 imperial maunds of cane jaggery during the months of February and
March 1948. The tender form contained a note in paragraph 2 which was meant for
the quantity required and the described dates of delivery. This note was :
""This Administration reserves the right to cancel the contract at any stage during the
tenure of the contract without calling up the outstandings on the unexpired portion
of the contract.""
2. The Deputy General Manager of the Railways, by his letter dated January 29, 1948, accepted this
tender. The letter asked the respondent to remit a sum of Rs. 7,900/- for security and said that on
receipt of the remittance, official order would be placed with the respondent. In his letter dated
February 16, 1948, the Deputy General Manager reiterated the acceptance of the tender subject to
the respondent's acceptance of the terms and conditions printed on the reverse of that letter. Among
these terms, the terms of delivery stated : Progr"

JUDGMENT  
I.D. Dua, J.  
(1) These two letters Patent Appeals (Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 26-D and 27-D of 1964) arise out of
the same proceedings and being directed against one main judgment of a learned Single Judge, may
be disposed of by one judgment. The only question falling for our determination relates to the plea
of limitation and lies within a narrow compass, namely, whether Article 97 of the Limitation Act
applies to the case or whether it is governed by the residuary Article 120, no other Article being
applicable in terms. Of course at one stage Shri hardy learned Counsel for the respondents also
attempted to apply Article 62 of the Limitation Act but this attempt was not seriously persisted in.
(2) Turning now to the facts on 26-11-1946, Messrs. Gokal Nagar Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (Hereafter
called the vendor Company) entered into an agreement to sell the building in question situated in
Lahore (now in West Pakistan) for a consideration of Rs.1,35,000/- to Shri Ram Lal Puri
(hereinafter called the vendee) who paid Rs.20,000/- by way of earnest money at the time of the
agreement. The sale was to be completed by 5-4-1947. On 1-4-1947, the vendee sought extension of
time for the completion of the sale upto 20-4-1947, to which the vendor company agreed. On
17-4-1947, the vendee paid Rs.30,000 as an additional advance seeking extension of time by another
month "

JUDGMENT  
  Tatachari, J.    
(1) This letters patent appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the High Court of Punjab
originally came up for hearing before a Division Bench of the High Court (S.S. Dulat and S.K. Kapur,

1. The respondent-hereinafter called 'the assessee'-has its Head Office at Calcutta and a Branch
Office at Jaipur, and is registered as a ""dealer"" under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954. Under a
contract dated September 2, 1948, with the Equitable Coal, Company the assessee acquired
monopoly rights to supply on behalf of the collieries, coal in certain areas including Rajasthan.
Under an agreement dated April 28, 1955, with the State of Rajasthan the assessee supplied coal to
the State Power Houses upto May 19, 1958. The Sales Tax Officer, City Circle A, Jaipur assessed to
tax the turnover of the assessee in the year 1955-56 from the supply of coal to the State of Rajasthan.
2. The assessee then moved a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of
Rajasthan for a writ quashing the order of assessment of the Sales Tax Officer. The High Court
accepted the plea that the assessee was not a dealer within the meaning of the Act and quashed the
assessment. In appeal by the State of Rajasthan against the order of the High Court, this Court held
that the assessee was a dealer within the meaning of the explanation to Section 2(f) of the Rajasthan
Sales Tax Act, since the assessee"

V. Ramaswami, J.
1. The appellant is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and carries on business
of mining manganese ore and selling the same to various buyers in India. For the calendar year 1st
January, 1958, to 31st December, 1958, the appellant was assessed to sales tax under the C.P. and
Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (since repealed by the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958).
During the said period the appellant had sold manganese ore to eight different parties outside the
State of Madhya Pradesh under written contracts. It was contended on behalf of the appellant before
the sales tax authorities that these contracts occasioned movement of the sold goods from the State
of Madhya Pradesh to the State of Maharashtra so that all the sales were exempt from tax under the
C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and also under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958
(2 of 1959), which repealed the former. The Sales Tax Officer, Chhindwara, rejected the contention
of the appellant and assessed all the sales to tax by his order of assessment dated 5th April, 1960, on
a taxable turnover of Rs. 2,22,918 and odd. The appellant took the matter in appeal to the Appellate
Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax but his appeal was dismissed. T"

JUDGMENT
J.C. Shah, J.
1. The appellants are a firm having their head office at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh and branch
offices at Lucknow, Kanpur, Faizabad and Bombay. They are engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling bidis, and are registered as dealers under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax
Act, 1947. Between November, 1948, and October 12, 1949, the appellants despatched bidis of the
value of Rs. 22,60,241-5-0 to their branch offices outside the State of Madhya Pradesh, and bidis of
the value of Rs. 5,35,404-15-0 under instructions from their branches to other destinations outside
the State. The Sales Tax Officer rejected the contention of the appellants that the turnover resulting
from the sale of bidis supplied to the branches and under instructions from the branches was not
liable to be taxed under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and brought the aggregate turnover
of Rs. 27,85,646-4-0 to tax. In appeal, the Deputy Commissioner reduced the taxable turnover by 5
per cent. The order of the Deputy Commissioner was confirmed in appeal to the Commissioner of
Sales Tax. A revision application filed before the Sales Tax Tribunal was unsuccessful.
2. At the instance of the appellants, the Tribunal submitted a statement"

JUDGMENT
R.S. Sarkaria, J.
1. The common question of law that arises in these appeals by the same assessee is : Whether the
sales in question made by the asses-see were sales effected in the course of export of goods out of the
territory of India and as such were exempt from imposition of sales tax under Article 286(1)(b) of
the Constitution ?
2. The relevant assessment years are 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60. The assessee, the New
Rajasthan Mineral Syndicate, is registered as a dealer under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948.
It is not registered under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for short, called the Act). The assessee
carries on the business of quarry contractOrs. In the relevant years, it held a licence from the then
Punjab State to quarry iron-ore at Nizampur, District Mohindergarh.
3. During the assessment years in question, the Sales Tax Officer assessed the assessee-firm to tax
under Section 9 of the Act on a turnover of Rs. 3,18,757.6, Rs. 3,99,948.93 and Rs. 5 lakhs,
respectively. The last assessment was made on the best judgment basis.
4. To impugn these assessment orders, the assessee filed three writ petitions "

JUDGMENT
R.S. Sarkaria, J.
1. Whether, on the facts of this case, the contract dated June 15, 1968, between the Union of India
and the Central India Machinery Manufacturing Company Ltd. (Wagon & Structural Division),
Bharatpur (hereinafter called the company), for the manufacture and supply of wagons, was a
contract of sale or a works contract, is the principal question that falls to be determined in this
appeal by certificate, filed by the Union of India against a judgment dated January 31, 1969, of the
High Court of Rajasthan. It arises out of these facts:
The company, respondent No. 1 herein, entered into a contract No.
67/RS(I)/954/l5/396 dated June 15, 1968, with the Union of India through the
Railway Board for the manufacture and supply of 258 BG Bogie covered BCX type
wagons and 812 MG covered wagons of MBC type to the railways. The sales tax
authorities of the State (respondent No. 3 herein) under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act,
levied the sales tax treating the contract as one of sale and delivery of wagons. Under
a similar past contract, the appellant reimbursed the company the amount of sales
tax for the wagons supplied by it to the appellant in the months of March and April,
1967. In March, 1967, the High Court of Mysore in the case of Hindustan Aeronautics

JUDGMENT
Bhagwati, J.
1. This appeal by special leave raises the vexed question whether a particular contract is a contract of
sale or a contract of work and labour. This has always been a difficult question, because most of the
cases which come before the courts are border line cases and the decisions given by courts are by no
means uniform. But so far as the present case is concerned, it does not present any serious difficulty
and is comparatively free from complexity or doubt for there is a decision of this Court which is
directly applicable and is determinative of the controversy between the parties.
2. The assessee who is the appellant before us is a private limited company carrying on business as
engineers, contractors, manufacturers and fabricators and in the course of its business, it entered
into a contract dated 28th June, 1972 with M/s. C.M. Shah & Co. (P) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as
the Company) for fabrication, supply, erection and installation of Sentinel's Pull and Push type and
reduction Gear type rolling Shutters in sheds Nos. 3 and 4 of the Sidheswar Sahakari Sakar
Karkhana belonging to the Company. The detailed specifications of the Rolling Shutters were given

JUDGMENT
V.R. Krishna Iyer, J.
1. The last judicial lap of the journey to gender justice made by Fazlunbi, a married woman just past
30 years and talaged into destitution, constitutes the compassionate core of this case. The saga of
Fazlunbi, who had earlier secured an order for maintenance in her favour Under Section 125 Cr. P.C.
which was cancelled Under Section 127(3)(b) Cr. P.C., by three courts, tier upon tier in the vertical
system, by concurrent misinterpretation of the relevant provision, constitutes the kernel of her legal
grievance. If her plea has substance, social justice has been jettisoned by judicial process and a just
and lawful claim due to a woman in distress has been denied heartlessly and lawlessly. We say
'heartlessly', because no sensitive judge with empathy for the weaker sex could have callously
cancelled an order for a monthly allowance already made in her favour, as has been done here. We
say lawlessly', because no disciplined judge bound by the decision of this Court which lays down the
law for the nation under Article 141 of the Constitution could have defied the crystal clear ruling of
this Court in Bai Tahir"

order of the Kerala High Court is whether the amount claimed by the Appellant in a suit filed by him
against the Respondent was a ""debt"" within the meaning of that expression as denned in Clause (3)
of Section 2 of the Kerala Debt Relief Act, 1977, (hereinafter referred to as ""the said Act"") and was,
therefore, deemed to be discharged.
2. The Appellant's case as founded in the plaint was that the Respondent sold a cow and.a calf to
him for a sum of Rs. 1,600, and that the cow did not yield the quantity of milk which the Respondent
had stated it would yield and was suffering from an incurable disease which was concealed from the
Appellant by the Respondent. For this reason, the Appellant asked the Respondent to buy back the
said cow and the calf for the same price which had been paid by the Appellant to the Respondent
and thereupon the Respondent agreed to buy back the said cow and calf for a sum of Rs. 1,600. In
pursuance of this agreement, the said cow and calf were returned by the Appellant to the
Respondent. By his letter dated October 27, 1976, the Respondent acknowledged that he had
received back the said cow and calf and assured the App"

JUDGMENT
A.P. Sen, J.
1. The short and narrow point involved in this appeal by special leave is whether upon the principles
laid down in United Commercial Bank v. Bank of India and Ors. the Court should not interfere in a
transaction between a banker and a beneficiary of a letter of guarantee or indemnity by grant of an
injunction at the instance of the buyer restraining the beneficiary from enforcing the liability under
the letter of indemnity executed by the banker which was absolute and upon a demand being made
by the beneficiary the bank became liable to honour the same, regardless of any controversy
between the parties i.e. the appellant who is the buyer, and respondent No. 1, the sellers, as to
whether the contract of sale had been performed.
2. Briefly stated, the facts are that the appellant, the buyer, covenanted to purchase and respondent
No. 1 Messrs Vinmar Impex Inc., Singapore, the sellers, agreed to sell and supply 100 M.T. of High
Density Polythene Powder called HOPE @ $565 per M.T. CIF, Calcutta on an irrevocable letter of
credit being opened by the appellant in favour of respondent "

1. Special leave is granted.
2. This appeal arises out of a suit for specific performance of a contract (Ext.1) entered into by the
vendor of the appellants and the respondent. The suit has been dismissed by the courts below on the
finding that under the deed of sale (Ext.2) obtained by the appellants the right of specific
performance of the aforesaid contract of sale was not conveyed. In the impugned judgment of the
High Court the learned judge has observed that the recitals in the appellants' sale deed (Ext.2) do
not indicate that the right of the appellants' vendor of re-conveyance of the property by the
defendant was transferred.
A certified copy of the sale deed (Ext.2), which is in Hindi, has been produced before us and we have
examined the document in its entirety and do not find ourselves in agreement with the view of the
courts below. The operative portion of the sale deed clearly records that all rights and privileges in
and concerning the suit property either in present or accruing in future as vesting in the appellants'
vendor, were the subject matter of the sale and that the vendor retained no right of any kind
whatsoever. We, therefore, hold that the right of re-conveyance under Ext.1 was transferred vide sale

JUDGMENT
1. This appeal arises from the Judgment of the Madras High Court in a Sales Tax Revision Case. The
appellant is a co-operative sugar factory having its sugar factory at Chittur in Kerala State. Inasmuch
as sufficient quantity of sugarcane was not available within the State of Kerala, the appellant and the
Government of Kerala approached the State of Tamil Nadu for supply of sugarcane to the
appellant-factory. In pursuance of the understanding arrived at between them, the Government of
Tamil Nadu issued an order contained in G.O.M.S. No. 2260 dated July 20,1963. By virtue of this
order, the appellant was permitted to draw sugarcane from not more than 3,000 acres in
Coimbatore and Pollachi taluks in Tamil Nadu, subject to the conditions specified therein. Condition
No. 5 read thus:
(Clause (5) : The Co-operative Sugar Ltd., Chittur, should remit to this Government
the Sales Tax on the cane supplies made from areas in Madras State. The basis for
purposes of calculation will be taken as 3% of the purchase price of cane for a
recovery of 9.8% (Rs. 1.62 per maund)
2. In pursuance of the said order, appellant opened its offices at Coimbatore and Pollachi. The
sugarcane inspectors from these offices used t"

in these matters is whether the 'medical representatives' as they are commonly known, are workmen
according to the definition of 'workman' under Section 2(s) of the industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the
'ID Act'). The definition under this section has undergone changes since its first enactment. It is
necessary to keep in mind the said changes since the decisions of this Court delivered on the point
from time to time are based on the definition, as it stood at the relevant time. The definition, as it
stood originally when the ID Act came into force w.e.f. 1-4-1947, read as follows-

ORDER
1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant judgment-debtor filed a petition in the executing Court to rescind the contract
dated January 16, 1976 on the plea that the respondent-plaintiff had committed default in
depositing the balance consideration of Rs. 4,351/- within one month from January 27, 1982 made
by the appellate decree in A.S. No. 213 of 1979. The executing Court dismissed the application on the
ground that the deposit was made within the time though the application on the execution side was
maintainable. On revision, the High Court in C.R.P. No. 593/90 dismissed the petition by judgment
dated August 11, 1992 holding it not maintainable on the execution side.
3. The only question that arises for consideration is whether an application under Section 27 of the

1. Leave granted.
2. The respondent in the appeal herein purchased six National Savings Certificates (VI Issue) for Rs.
10,000 each on 28-4-1987 from the Post Office. The rate of interest payable with effect from
1-4-1987 was 11%. This was notified by the Government of India. Due to inadvertence on the part of
the clerical staff, the old rate of interest and the maturity value which was printed on the certificates
could not be corrected. The District Forum as well as the State Commission came to the conclusion
that the Government of India/Post Office were bound to pay the unconnected maturity value of the
certificates indicated on each of the printed certificates. The contentions raised by the learned
counsel for the Union of India that there was a notification issued by the Government of India
prescribing the rate of interest as 11% and that due to inadvertence on the part of the clerical staff of
the Post Office the printed maturity value was not scored off from the certificates, were not accepted
by the District Forum and the State Commission. The revision filed by the Union of India before the
National Commission was dismissed by a majority decision. Mr. Y. Krishnan, the dissenting
Member disagreed with the findings of the District Forum and State Commission and c"

correctness of certain earlier decisions of this Court, concept of unjust enrichment, interpretation of
Article 265 of the Constitution of India and of the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act,
1944 and the Customs Act et al. As far back as August 14, 1984, Civil Appeal No. 1794 of 1984 and
the connected special leave petitions were referred to a Bench of seven Judges by a Bench of two
learned Judges, since the referring Bench doubted the correctness of the five-Judge Bench decision
in Sales Tax Officer, Benaras and Ors. v. Kanhaiyalal Mukundlal Saraf [1959] S.C.R. 1350. When the
matter came up before a seven-Judge Bench, it was brought to our notice that a seven-Judge Bench
has followed the decision in Kanhaiyalal in State of Kerala v. Aluminium Industries Limited (1965)
16 S.T.C. 689. Accordingly, the matters we"

The common question that arises for consideration in all these appeals is whether a Pawn-broker is
a dealer and carries on 'business' within the meaning of the State General Sales Tax Act read with
the State Pawnbrokers Act and Rules when he causes the sales of unredeemed articles/goods,
occasioned by the default of the Pawner through (statutory) Auctioneer.
The above question has to be considered with reference to the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act read with the Tamil Nadu Pawnbrokers Act and Rules as well as the Karnataka Sales
Tax Act read with the Karnataka Pawnbrokers Act and Rules. We may point out that the relevant
provisions of both the Sales Tax Acts and the Pawnbrokers Act are substantially the same and for the
sake of convenience the provisions mentioned hereinafter are the provisions of the Karnataka Acts.
Before going into the submissions advanced at the bar, certain basic background facts need to be
stated.
Pawn-broker is a person who carries on the business of taking goods and chattels in pawn for a loan.
On payment of the money lent with interest and other admissible incidental expenses the

ORDER
1. Special leave granted.
2. The respondent has been served and has put in an appearance and filed a counter. It was not
represented when the SLP had been called out on an earlier date, when it was adjourned due to its
absence. It is not represented today, even after the SLP has been passed over once.
3. The order that is under appeal was passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission. It says: ""In our opinion, Section 230 of the Contract Act in terms will apply only to
suits instituted before a regular civil court and not to complaints filed under the Consumer
Protection Act which is a special legislation intended to protect consumers in India against the
exploitation of manufacturers, traders and providers of service by supply of defective goods or by
deficiency in service resulting in loss to the consumer.""
The National Commission took the view that, inasmuch as the respondent was pursuing the remedy
available to it under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and had claimed that it had
hired the services of the appellant and there was deficiency in rendering such services, its complaint
was maintainable, for the protection given to an agent under Section 230 of the Contract"

J. An important question of law under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (hereinafter called `the Act')
has arisen for our consideration in this appeal.
The question is whether the Insurance Policy lapses and consequently the liability of the insurer
ceases when the insured vehicle was transferred and no application/intimation as prescribed under
section 103A of the Act was made/given.
We find from the case law cited before us at the bar that there are conflicting views among the High
Courts on this issue. "

The cases in this batch raise common issues relating to the identification of 'creamy layer' among the
Backward Classes in the State of Kerala and the implementation of the law declared and directions
issued in Indira Sawhney Vs. Union of India ( 1992 (Suppl) 3, SCC 217). The State of Kerala took
time for implementation of the directions in Indira Sawhney for appointment of a Commission for
the purpose of identifying the creamy layer in the State but it failed to appoint a Commission or to

the State of Kerala did not implement the judgment. This Court by its order dated 10.7.1995 held ( in

These two Appeals by the grant of Special Leave and arising out of the Judgment of the Delhi High
Court focus two singularly singular questions pertaining to (i) the time being the essence of the
contract and (ii) authority of the High Court in the matter of interference with an Arbitral Award
under the Repealed Act of 1940 (The Arbitration Act, 1940). For effectual disposal of these two
questions, noticed above, reference to certain factual details in this judgment is inevitable and
adverting thereto it appears that on October 4, 1989 Union of India floated an invitation to tender
for purchase of sugar to meet the urgent requirement of anticipated scarcity in the Indian market
during the Dussehra and Diwali festivals in November, 1989 which however, and without much of a

JUDGMENT:
BANERJEE, J The doctrine of equality as enshrined in the Constitution promised an egalitarian
society and the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 is the resultant effect of such a
constitutional mandate having its due focus in that perspective. This Court in Minerva Mills' case (
AIR 1980 SC 1789) in no uncertain terms laid down that the equality clause in the Constitution does
not speak of mere formal equality before the law but embodies the concept of real and substantive
equality which strikes at the inequalities arising on account of vast social and economic
differentiation and is thus consequently an essential ingredient of social and economic justice. In
short, this Court has equated the security clause in the Constitution so as to mean that the people of
the country ought to be secured of socio-economic justice by way of a fusion of Fundamental Right
and Directive Principles of State Policy. As a matter of fact this Court has been candid enough on
more occasions than one and rather, frequently to note that socialism ought not to be treated as a
mere concept or an ideal, but the same ought to be practised in every sphere of life and be treated by
the law courts as a constitut"

certain questions of law and conviction and sentence proposed by him on some of the accused.

These are judgment- debtors two appeals against common judgment dated December 24, 1997 of
the Madras High Court, passed in revision of the order of the executing court dismissing execution
applications filed by the respondent decree-holders. The decrees are for specific performance of two
agreements of sale of certain immovable properties.
The appellant, as owner of the property being two plots of land, each measuring 60 x 40, entered
into two separate but similar agreements of sale dated February 16, 1980 with the respondent
decree-holders. Since the judgment-debtor failed to perform his part of the agreements,
decree-holders filed suits for specific performance of the contract of sale in the court of the District
Munsif, Pudukottai. The suits were decreed in favour of the respondents with a direction to them to
deposit the balance amount of consideration and with further direction to the appellant to execute
the sale-deeds. The suits were decreed on January 31, 1983 and the balance consideration amount
was to be deposited on or before March 31, 1983. Against the judgment and order decreeing the suits

L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J The main issue posed in this appeal has sequential
importance for members of the legal profession. The issue is this: Has the advocate a lien for his fees
on the litigation papers entrusted to him by his client? In this case the Bar Council of India, without
deciding the above crucial issue, has chosen to impose punishment on a delinquent advocate
debarring him from practicing for a period of 18 months and a fine of Rs.1000/-. The advocate
concerned was further directed to return all the case bundles which he got from his client
respondent without any delay. This appeal is filed by the said advocate under Section 38 of the
Advocates Act, 1961.
As the question involved in this appeal has topical importance for the legal profession we heard
learned counsel at length. To appreciate the contentions we would present the factual backdrop as
under:
Appellant, now a septuagenarian, has been practicing as an advocate mostly in the
courts at Bhopal, after enrolling himself as a legal practitioner with the State Bar

(1) Despite the decisions of this Court in Builders Association of India and others
vs.Union of India and others (1989) 2 SCC 645 and M/s. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.
and others vs. State of Rajasthan and others (1993) 1 SCC 364, the controversy as regards the power
of the State legislature to levy sales tax under clause (29A)(d) of Article 366 of the Constitution in
the context of the question where is the taxable event on the transfer of right to use any goods
remained unresolved. In this group of cases, we are concerned with the power of States legislatures
to levy sales tax on the transfer of right to use any goods envisaged under clause (29A)(d) of Article
366 of the Constitution on the premise that goods put to use are located within their States. Several
States by their legislations have levied tax on the transactions of transfer of right to use goods on the
location of goods at the time of their use within their States irrespective of the place where the

I agree with the conclusions of the judgment prepared by My Lord, the Chief Justice
of India that the matter should be remitted back to the tribunal but I would like to
assign additional reasons therefor.
The basic fact on the matter has been noticed by My Lord, the Chief Justice of India.
I may, however, point out that the learned counsels appearing on behalf of the parties
have raised a large number of contentions.
They not only filed written submissions before this Court, our attention has also been
drawn to the written submissions filed before the learned TDSAT. The questions
raised are numerous and varied. The learned counsels have also taken us through a
large number of documents. A large number of charts have been filed before us for

respondent for various P&I risks for which they had been insured. These unpaid
insurance calls being ""necessaries"" was enforceable within the ""admiralty

granted in SLP (C) No.9334 of 2000.
A common question of law centering around Sections 107 and 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872
arises for decision in these two appeals.
In Civil Appeal No. 2655 of 1999 Sham Prakash Sharma, the late husband of Mrs. Anuradha, the
respondent, had taken a life insurance policy from the appellant-Life Insurance Corporation of India
(hereinafter, the LIC or Corporation for short). The policy commenced with effect from 8.2.1986.
The premium was payable every six months. For two years, the premium was paid. On 17.7.1988
Sham Prakash Sharma was at Bombay wherefrom he just disappeared, never to be traced out
thereafter. The respondent, Anuradha, lodged a first information report with the police. On 11th
July, 1988, the LIC had sent a communication addressed to Sham Prakash Sharma and delivered at
his residence informing that the insurance policy had lapsed for nonpayment of premium. On
29.6.1996, the respondent approached the LIC for release of benefits under the policy proceeding on
an assumption that Sham Prakash was dead as having not been heard of for a period of more than
seven years."

The challenge made to the constitutional validity of amendments made to the Code of Civil
Procedure (for short, 'the Code') by Amendment Acts of 1999 and 2002 was rejected by this Court
{Salem Advocates Bar Association, T.N. v. Union of India [(2003) 1 SCC 49]}, but it was noticed in
the judgment that modalities have to be formulated for the manner in which Section 89 of the Code
and, for that matter, the other provisions which have been introduced by way of amendments, may
have to be operated. For this purpose, a Committee headed by a former Judge of this Court and
Chairman, Law Commission of India (Justice M. Jagannadha Rao) was constituted so as to ensure

1. What is the nature of the function of the Chief Justice or his designate under
Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is the question that is posed
before us. The three judges bench decision in Konkan Rly. Corporation Ltd. v. Mehul
Construction Co. as approved by the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway
Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. has taken the view that it is
purely an administrative function, that it is neither judicial nor quasi-judicial and the
Chief Justice or his nominee performing the function under Section 11(6) of the Act,
cannot decide any contentious issue between the parties.

The principal question to be decided in these matters is the nature of the transaction by which
mobile phone connections are enjoyed. Is it a sale or is it a service or is it both? If it is a sale then the
States are legislatively competent to levy sales tax on the transaction under Entry 54 List II of the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. If it is a service then the Central Government alone can levy
service tax under Entry 97 of List I (or Entry 92C of List I after 2003). And if the nature of the
transaction partakes of the character of both sale and service, then the moot question would be
whether both legislative authorities could levy their separate taxes together or only one of them. The
contenders are the service providers on the one hand and the States on the other. It is the case of the
service providers (who are for the purposes of convenience referred to in this judgment a"

Leave granted. The general scope of Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (`Code' for short) and
the question whether the said section empowers the court to refer the parties to a suit to arbitration
without the consent of both parties, arise for consideration in this appeal.
2. The second respondent (Cochin Port Trust) entrusted the work of construction of certain bridges
and roads to the appellants under an agreement dated 20.4.2001. The appellants sub-contracted a
part of the said work to the first respondent under an agreement dated 1.8.2001. It is not in dispute
that the agreement between the appellants and the first respondent did not contain any provision
for reference of the disputes to arbitration.
3. The first respondent filed a suit against the appell"

K. S. Radhakrishnan, J.
The question that falls for consideration in this case is whether an assessee (local manufacturer) is
eligible to get exemption under sub-section (3) of Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for
short `CST Act'), if the penultimate sale effected in favour of the exporter is inextricably connected
with the export of goods outside the territory of India.
2. This Court in Md. Serajuddin & Others v. State of Orissa (1975) 2 SCC 47, held that, under Article
286 of the Constitution, the sale which was not liable to tax under the State Sales Tax was only the
actual sale by the exporter, but the benefit of export sale did not extend to the penultimate sale to
the Indian exporter for the purpose of export. This led to the insertion of sub- section (3) of Section

2. The appellant herein had agreed to sell a plot of land to the respondent by virtue of an agreement
entered into with him on 2nd August, 1999. Inasmuch as the appellant failed to hand over the
possession of the concerned plot of land, the respondent filed a complaint, bearing No.62 of 2000,
before the District Consumer Redressal Forum at Wardha. The appellant had raised the contention
that the Consumer Forum had no jurisdiction to try the matter and a claim for specific performance
of the agreement would lie only before the Civil Court and not before the District Consumer
Redressal Forum. The District Forum, however, in its order dated 10.10.2000 took the view that no
civil dispute was involved, and that it was a case of deficiency in rendering service to the respondent.
The District Forum therefore passed an order directing the"

2. Shyam Kapoor, the respondent herein, preferred a complaint before the District Consumer Forum
IInd, Lucknow (hereinafter referred to as the ‘District Forum’), asserting that he had deposited a
sum of Rs.5,000/- with the Lucknow Development Authority, i.e., the appellant herein, on
1.12.1982. The aforesaid deposit had been made for allotment of a 6,000 sq. ft. plot in the ‘A’
category under the Gomti Nagar Residential Scheme (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Scheme’). It was
alleged, that the Lucknow Development Authority had neither allotted any plot to the
respondent-complainant, nor returned the deposit tendered by him. The appellant herein, however,
issued a press notice in 1991 requiring persons similarly situated as the respondent-complainant,"

final Order No. 142/03-B dated 18.02.2003, passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control)
Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short “the Tribunal”). By the impugned order, the Tribunal has
upheld the levy of customs duty on the import of furnace oil as also the penalty under Section 112 of
the Act, rejecting the plea of the appellant that demand of the duty along with the penalty was
barred by limitation.

1. India’s capital market in the recent times has witnessed tremendous growth, characterized
particularly by increasing participation of public. Investors’ confidence in the capital market can be
sustained largely by ensuring investors’ protection. Disclosure and transparency are the two pillars
on which market integrity rests. Facts of the case disclose how the investors’ confidence has been
eroded and how the market has been abused for personal gains and attainments.
2. The Appellate Jurisdiction of this Court guaranteed under Section 15Z of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short ‘SEBI Act’) has been invoked challenging a joint order
dated 5.10.2012 passed in Appeal Nos. 28 and 29 of 2012 passed by Securities Appellate Tribunal,

2. In this appeal, the appellant challenges the final judgment and order dated 20th April, 2012
passed by the Delhi High Court in L.P.A. No. 22/2012. In the said order, the Division Bench
dismissed the appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge dated 8th December, 2011,
wherein the Single Judge held that “the information sought by the appellant herein is the third party
information wherein third party may plead a privacy defence and the proper question would be as to
whether divulging of such an information is in the public interest or not.” Thus, the matter has been
remitted back to Chief Information Commissioner to consider the issue after following the
procedure under Section 11 of the Right to Information Act.

This Civil Appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated 03.07.2007 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Second Appeal No. 516 of 1988 whereby it has set aside the
impugned judgment and orders therein passed by the courts below on the ground that both the
courts below not only committed error of record by misconstruing the facts and evidence on record
but also ignored the specific provisions of law as well as the necessary and relevant case laws and
also wrongly held that the Title Suit No. 68 of 1978 was barred by the principles of res judicata.
The facts which are required to appreciate the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties
are stated in brief hereunder:
The appellant-Indian Oil Corporation Limited (for short “IOCL”) in the year 1971

distributorship of Indane Gas (LPG) Agencies in the town of Muzaffarpur, Bihar. The

Constitutional validity of Entry 25 of Schedule VI to the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Act') is the subject matter of the present appeal. It is the third endeavour to
resurrect this entry, when on the first two occasions, the steps taken by the State were declared as
impermissible. Even this time, the High Court has dumped the amendment as unconstitutional.
However, the reasons advanced by the High Court in all three rounds are different. While traversing
through the historical facts leading to the issue at hand, we shall be referring to the same for clear
understanding of the controversy involved.

allowed the original appeal filed by the respondent and held that the respondent rendered actual
service to the extent of 14 years by rounding off, which makes him eligible for consideration of
condonation of shortfall of pensionable service of one year and in view of striking off of Rule 82(a)
the respondent cannot be denied the benefit of condonation of shortfall in service on the ground
that he took the discharge from service voluntarily on his own request. Therefore,"

Part I : Introductory
1. This appeal has been preferred under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (‘the Act’) against
the judgment and order dated 22nd February, 2010 passed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity
(the Tribunal) in Appeal No.86 of 2009 whereby the Tribunal has set aside the order of the Gujarat
Electricity Regulatory Commission (‘the Commission’) which was in favour of the appellant.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The only question that has arisen in this appeal is
whether a second complaint to the District Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is
maintainable when the first complaint was dismissed for default or non- prosecution.

Civil Appeal No. 2402 of 2019 titled Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation,1 as it
doubts the legal ratio expressed in Himangni Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia2 that
landlord-tenant disputes governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property 1 2019 SCC OnLine
SC 358 2 (2017) 10 SCC 706 Act, 1882, are not arbitrable as this would be contrary to public policy.

       2.                Indian Law has proceeded on the assumption that parents are
       persons who beget a child or who assume the legal obligations of
       parenthood through formal adoption of child. Under the Indian legal
       spectrum, a husband is strongly presumed to be the father of a child
       born to his wife. Thus, there is a strong presumption regarding the
       paternity of a child. This presumption can be overcome only by evidence
       precluding any procreative role of the husband, such as by showing that
       the husband and wife had no access to each other at the relevant time

1. The issue arising in the present appeal relates to enforcement of an arbitral award expressed in
foreign currency. In this context, two questions arise for consideration. First, what is the correct and
appropriate date to determine the foreign exchange rate for converting the award amount expressed
in foreign currency to Indian rupees. Second, what would be the date of such conversion, when the
award debtor deposits some amount before the court during the pendency of proceedings
challenging the award. Two uncertainties have a direct bearing on the question to be answered, the
time lapse between the date of the award and its enforceability- Date: 2024.08.08 17:41:47 IST

over the strong.” The power structures of our society are such that the weaker ones often find
themselves exploited and oppressed by those who yield greater power. Land ownership is one such
arena where we see the swords of powerplay being sharpened with continued fraud, deceit, and
greed. While we shall deal with the facts of the present case in SONIA BHASIN detail later, it is a

1. The present civil appeal has been filed by the complainant, who is the daughter of the
insured-deceased Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu, who is also the nominee under the subject life
insurance policies of her late father. The appellant is assailing the order dated 22.07.2019 passed by
the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as
“NCDRC”) in Revision Petition No.1268 of 2019.
2. By the impugned order, the NCDRC has allowed the revision petition filed by the
respondent-opposite party, thereby setting aside the orders passed by the District Consumer Forum
and the State Consumer Forum and sustaining the repudiation of the complainant’s claim by the
opposite party insurer-company.

1. The present appeal arises from the judgment dated 30.06.2014 of the Appellate Tribunal for
Electricity (for short the “APTEL”) in Appeal No. 29 of 2013. By the said judgement, the APTEL
dismissed the appeal of the appellant and confirmed the order dated 12.11.2012 of the Punjab State
Electricity Regulatory Commission (for short the “State Commission”), insofar as issue no. 1
discussed therein was concerned. That issue concerned the aspect of Mega Power Policy and the
effect of the Press Release of 01.10.2009. We are only concerned with the said issue in this Appeal.

1. What are the legal implications of a promotional trailer, popularly known as a ‘promo’, or a teaser

trailers are unilateral and do not qualify as offers eliciting acc"

2. The instant appeal impugns the judgment dated 21.05.2018 passed by a Single Judge of the
Kerala High Court (Ernakulam) (High Court), upholding the Family Court’s order dated 09.11.2015
reviving a maintenance petition on the following grounds: (i) paternity and legitimacy are
independent concepts in law; (ii) the Civil Courts did not have jurisdiction to entertain the original

Court could proceed to determine paternity as incidental to the maintenance proceedings.
