Amratolla Street, free from all encumbrances at a price  not
less  than Rs. 1,00","Abdulla Ahmed, an estate broker, sued Animendra Kissen Mitter for commission owed after securing buyers for Mitter's property. Ahmed found buyers willing to pay Rs. 1,10,000, but Mitter later sold the property to the same buyers for Rs. 1,05,000. The dispute centers on whether Ahmed is entitled to commission based on the initial offer or the final sale price.","The court analyzed the commission note to determine the scope of Ahmed's authority and the conditions for earning commission. The judges considered whether Ahmed was authorized to conclude a binding contract and whether commission was contingent on the completion of the transaction. Precedents regarding estate agents and commission contracts were reviewed, including Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Cooper.","The appeal outcome is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the judgment discusses varying opinions on the amount of commission payable, suggesting a modification of the original judgment."

Mac Pherson claimed that Appanna's cable stating he wouldn't accept less than Rs. 10,000 was a counter-offer which Mac Pherson accepted, forming a binding contract. Appanna, however, sold the property to another party for a higher price.","The court relied on the precedent of Harvey v. Facey, holding that a statement of the lowest price at which a vendor would sell does not constitute an implied contract to sell at that price. The court interpreted Appanna's cable as merely an invitation for offers, not a counter-offer. Therefore, Mac Pherson's subsequent letter was considered a fresh offer that Appanna never accepted.","The appeal was allowed, the judgment and decree of the Judicial Commissioner were set aside, and Mac Pherson's suit was dismissed, meaning no compensation was awarded."

the  plaintiff could have made was not only admitted by  the
defendant  in  his written statement but was  expressly  put
forward  as an answer to the claim which the plaintiff  made
in  the suit. ","Srinivas Ram Kumar sued Mahabir Prasad and others for specific performance of a contract to sell a house, claiming he paid Rs. 30,000 towards the price and was put in possession. The defendants denied the sale agreement, stating the Rs. 30,000 was a loan and possession was for interest payment. The plaintiff's claim for specific performance was dismissed by lower courts.","The court acknowledged the general rule that relief cannot be granted on a case not pleaded. However, it cited the precedent of Babu Raja Mohan Manucha v. Babu Manzoor, stating that when the defendant admits an alternative case in their written statement, a decree can be granted based on the defendant's own plea, especially when no injustice results. The court found that the plaintiff could be granted a decree for recovery of the loan amount based on the defendant's admission, even though it was inconsistent with the original claim.","The appeal regarding specific performance was dismissed, but the court allowed the appeal regarding the money decree, reinstating the trial court's decision to grant the plaintiff a decree for the recovery of Rs. 30,000 with interest, based on the defendant's admission of the loan."

The   Madhya  Pradesh  Abo","Chhotabrai Jethabai Patel and Co. entered into contracts with proprietors of estates in Madhya Pradesh to collect tendu leaves, lac, timber, etc. The State of Madhya Pradesh, after enacting the Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, sought to interfere with these rights, claiming they vested in the State. The petitioners sought writs to prevent the State from interfering with their contractual rights.","The court analyzed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, 1950, particularly sections 3 and 4, to determine if the petitioners' rights were affected. The court held that the contracts were essentially licenses and not proprietary rights, and therefore did not vest in the State. The court also considered the Indian Sale of Goods Act, section 4(3), but found it inapplicable as the goods were not 'future goods' as defined in the Act. Mohanlal Hargovind v. Commissioner of Income-tax, C.P,& Berar was referred to.",The court allowed the petitions and issued a writ prohibiting the State from interfering with the petitioners' rights under the contracts they had entered into with the proprietors.

JUDGMENT
 Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. 
1. This is an appeal by the defendant against the decree of the High Court of Nagpur which reversed
the decree of the Additional District Judge, Khamgaon, dismissing the plaintiff's suit. Leave to
appeal was granted as the value of the subject-matter of the suit in the trial Court was Rs. 35,000
and as there were substantial questions of law.
2. The property involved is a Ginning and a Pressing factory situated at Khamgaon and the case for
the plaintiff is that they belonged originally to Sir Hukumchand and his son Rajkumarsing from
whom he purchased the factories for a sum of Rs. 35,000 under a registered sale deed, dated
26-11-1939. Prior to the sale, there was a letter or note on 3-11-1939, setting out the agreement
between the parties relating to the sale. On the next day, possession of the factories was handed over
to one Seth Chapsi Dhanji at Khamgaon on behalf of the plaintiff. Two days afterwards, i. e. on the
6th of November, Sir Hukumchand entered into a fresh agreement to sell with the defendant, but
this was behind the back of the plaintiff. On the 7th of November, the defendant's men attempted to
take forcible possession of the factories from Chapsi Dhanji, plaintiff's representative on the
premises.
Ultimately, the defendant's agent one Nathmal resorted t","Hemraj sued Rustomji seeking a declaration of ownership over a Ginning and Pressing factory, claiming he purchased it from Sir Hukumchand before Rustomji entered into a subsequent agreement to buy the same property. The dispute centers around which sale agreement is valid and whether Hemraj consented to Rustomji's purchase. The product involved is the Ginning and Pressing factory.","The court analyzed the validity of the sale agreements under the Transfer of Property Act and the Specific Relief Act. Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act was deemed inapplicable as the defendant was not a transferee for value in good faith. The court also considered Section 27 of the Specific Relief Act, noting that Hemraj could have sued for specific performance against Sir Hukumchand and Rustomji had he not already secured a registered conveyance.","The appeal by Rustomji was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that Hemraj was the rightful owner of the Ginning and Pressing factory."

Mukherjee fraudulently obtained the shares from the defendant bank's agent without paying and pledged them with the plaintiff bank. The dispute centers on whether the plaintiff bank could claim protection under Section 30(2) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act.,"The court analyzed Section 30(2) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act, focusing on the meaning of ""consent"" in the context of possession obtained by a buyer who has agreed to buy goods. The court referred to Section 13 of the Indian Contract Act to define ""consent"" as ""agreeing on the same thing in the same sense,"" distinguishing it from ""free consent"" under Section 14. The court also discussed several English cases, including Folkes v. King and Lake v. Simmons, to clarify the interpretation of consent in similar statutory provisions.","The appeal was dismissed, affirming the Calcutta High Court's decision that Mukherjee did not obtain possession of the shares with the consent of the seller, and therefore, the plaintiff bank did not acquire any title against the defendant bank."

  Under  the Madras Sales Tax Act, 1939, as it stood  before
it  was amended by the Madras Act XXV of 1947,the mere  fact
tha","Poppatlal Shah, a partner in Indo-Malayan Trading Company, was convicted for failing to pay sales tax assessed under the Madras General Sales Tax Act. The company received orders from Calcutta merchants, purchased goods in Madras, and dispatched them to Calcutta, retaining ownership until payment in Calcutta. The dispute centers on whether these sales were taxable in Madras, considering the property transfer occurred outside the province.","The court analyzed the Madras Sales Tax Act (IX of 1939), specifically sections 2 and 8 (before the 1947 amendment), focusing on the definition of ""sale within the province."" The court considered the territorial nexus principle, citing Wallace Brothers etc., & Company v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay. It determined that the Act's definition of ""sale"" emphasized the transfer of property, and the title and preamble indicated an intent to tax sales taking place within the province, which was interpreted to mean where the property in goods passed.","The High Court's judgment was reversed, implying that the appellant's conviction was overturned. The court held that the sales were not liable to be taxed under the Madras General Sales Tax Act."

HEADNOTE:
The  doctrine of frustration is really an aspect or part  of
the  law of discharge of contract by reason  of  supervening
impossibility or illegality of the act agreed to be done and
hence  comes  within  the purview of S.  56
  of  the  Indian
Contract Act.. The view that s. 56 applies only to cases  of
physical  impossibility and","Satyabrata Ghose, as nominee/assignee of Bejoy Krishna Roy, sued Mugneeram Bangur & Co. seeking a declaration that a contract for sale of land was still subsisting and for specific performance. The defendant company argued that the contract was discharged due to frustration because the land was requisitioned by the government for military purposes, making it impossible to construct roads and drains as agreed. The core dispute revolves around the applicability of the doctrine of frustration to a contract for the sale of land under Indian law.","The court analyzed Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, which deals with the doctrine of frustration due to impossibility of performance. It clarified that Section 56 is a rule of positive law and not based on the parties' intentions. The court distinguished between cases where the contract itself contains terms for discharge upon certain events (covered under Section 32) and cases where frustration arises from unexpected events fundamentally altering the contract's basis. The court also addressed the applicability of the doctrine of frustration to contracts for the sale of land, noting that unlike English law, Indian law does not confer ownership upon the buyer upon agreement to sell.","The court held that the requisition did not affect the fundamental basis of the contract, nor did it make performance illegal; therefore, the contract had not become impossible within the meaning of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act. The document does not explicitly state whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed."

 ",The State of Travancore-Cochin appealed against Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory's claim for exemption from sales tax on cashew nut purchases after the Constitution of India came into force in 1950. The cashew nut factory argued that Article 286 (1)(b) of the Constitution prohibited the state from levying tax on their purchases related to import and export. The dispute centered on whether the purchases qualified for exemption under constitutional provisions related to sales occurring outside the state or during import/export.,"The court analyzed Article 286 (1)(a), 286 (1)(b), and 286(2) of the Constitution of India concerning the state's power to tax sales and purchases of goods, particularly in the context of inter-state trade, import, and export. The court interpreted the term ""in the course of"" import or export, distinguishing between activities directly causing export/import and preparatory actions. The court also considered the impact of the Sales Tax Continuance Order of 1950.","The High Court's order quashing the assessments was partially upheld and partially overturned, with the court providing specific guidance on which types of purchases were exempt from sales tax based on their nature (local, inter-state, import-related) and the role of intermediaries; the outcome varied depending on the specific circumstances of each type of purchase."

Parakh and Company, challenged the vires of certain provisions of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, specifically Explanation II to section 2(g), as amended. The company, involved in the cotton business, argued that the state was illegally imposing sales tax on transactions that were not 'sales' within the state, infringing on their fundamental rights. The grievance stemmed from the state's attempt to tax sales based on the location of goods at the time of contract, even if delivery occurred outside the state.","The court analyzed Explanation II to section 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as amended by Act XVI of 1949, in light of Article 286(1)(a) of the Constitution and the principles established in *The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd.* The court found that the explanation was ultra vires the State Legislature because it allowed taxation of sales involving inter-state elements by a state other than the one where goods were delivered for consumption. The court also cited *Mohd. Yasin v. The Town Area Committee* to support the view that an illegal imposition operates as an illegal restraint on trade and violates fundamental rights.","The appeal was allowed, and the court held that the imposition of sales tax on the appellant in Madhya Pradesh was without the authority of law, entitling them to relief under Article 226 of the Constitution."

The company filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, which was dismissed by the High Court.","The Supreme Court analyzed Article 286 of the Constitution, particularly clauses (1)(a), (1)(b), (2), and (3), and the Explanation to clause (1)(a). The court held that these clauses deal with different topics and cannot be read into one another. It determined that the situs of a sale is irrelevant to its inter-State character and that until Parliament legislates otherwise, states cannot tax inter-State sales. The court also reviewed its prior decision in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. and departed from it.","The appeal was allowed. The Supreme Court held that the Bihar Sales Tax Act, insofar as it taxes inter-State sales, is unconstitutional, illegal, and void, but not wholly ultra vires as it is feasible to separate taxes levied on authorized subjects from those levied on exempted subjects."

Budh Prakash Jai Prakash. The respondent firm was assessed taxes on forward contracts, which they challenged as ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature. The core dispute revolves around whether forward contracts can be considered 'sales' for the purpose of taxation under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act.","The court analyzed the definition of 'sale' under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, XV of 1948, specifically section 2(h) which includes forward contracts. It contrasted this with the established distinction between 'sale' and 'agreement to sell' under the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, and the English Sale of Goods Act, 1893. The court cited Colley v. Overseas Exporters ([1921] 3 K. B. 302) to emphasize that an action for price is maintainable only when there is a completed sale involving transfer of property, not merely an agreement to sell.","The appeal was dismissed, and the High Court's decision to quash the assessment orders and prohibit further assessment proceedings on forward contracts was upheld."

The dispute arose when the Commission, through an authorized official, sought to extend the investigation beyond the years 1942 and 1943, prompting the petitioner to file a writ petition challenging the Commission's jurisdiction.","The court analyzed the Travancore Act XIV of 1124, particularly section 5(1), in conjunction with section 47 of the Travancore Income-Tax Act, 1121. The court held that the Commission's authority was limited to cases specifically referred to it by the Government and that the authorized official's jurisdiction was confined to the years specified in the Government's orders. The court also determined that section 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was not discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.","The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision prohibiting the respondents from conducting an inquiry into years other than 1942 and 1943, finding that the notice to investigate income from 1940 to the last completed assessment year was illegal and without jurisdiction."

Ram Narain Sons Ltd and other similar firms, registered as dealers under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, were assessed sales tax on transactions involving the sale of goods (primarily cotton or kapas) that were ultimately delivered for consumption outside Madhya Pradesh. The firms contested the inclusion of these transactions in their turnover, arguing that they were exempt from taxation under Article 286 of the Constitution. The main grievance was the imposition of sales tax on goods delivered outside the state for consumption.","The court analyzed Article 286 of the Constitution, particularly clauses (1)(a) and (2) and the Explanation to (1)(a), to determine the taxing powers of the States. It held that the bans imposed by Article 286 are independent and separate, and the proviso to Article 286(2) only lifts the ban under that clause, not the ban under Article 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation. The court also found that Explanation II to Section 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, offended Article 286(1)(a).","The assessment was deemed invalid in toto due to the wrongful inclusion of items expressly exempted from taxation. The specific outcome regarding whether the appeals were allowed or dismissed is not explicitly stated in the provided document excerpt, but the finding that the assessment was invalid suggests a favorable outcome for the appellants."

The dispute centered on the calculation of net assessable turnover, specifically regarding deductions for copra purchased and oil sold both inside and outside the State of Travancore-Cochin. Fernandez argued that he should be able to deduct the total value of copra purchased from the total value of oil sold, including inter-state sales.","The court analyzed the Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act, 1125, and the associated rules, particularly sections related to the definition of 'sale' and 'turnover'. Section 26, added by amendment, prohibited tax on inter-state sales. The court relied on the precedent of Aswani Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose to interpret the non-obstante clause in Section 26, concluding that inter-state trade transactions should be excluded from both gross and net turnover calculations.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Sales Tax Officer's calculation of the net turnover."

JUDGMENT:
JUDGMENT 1958 AIR (SC) 764 Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the
15th November, 1954, of the Orissa High Court in S J C No. 174 of 1951. (Civil Appeal No. 193 of
1956), decided on February 19, 1958.
The Judgment was delivered by S. K. DAS, J. :
S. K. DAS, J. - This is an appeal by special leave. The Collector of Commercial Taxes,
Orissa, is the appellant, and Messrs Bharat Sabai Grass Ltd. are the respondents. The
respondents entered appearance and filed a statement of their case; but later they
withdrew appearance and at the final hearing of the appeal, we have had the
assistance of the learned Solicitor-General alone, who appeared in support of the
appeal.
The facts relating to the appeal lie within a very narrow compass. Messrs Bharat
Sabai Grass Ltd., a limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act,
1913, had their head office in Calcutta. They carried on the business of collection of
bamboo and sabai grass in Orissa and sold the same to certain mills which
manufacture paper, namely, the Orient Paper Mill, which is situate in Ori","The Collector of Commercial Taxes, Cuttack, appealed against Bharat Sabai Grass Ltd. regarding sales tax assessment under the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947. The company, dealing in bamboo and sabai grass, was assessed for sales made to mills in Orissa and Bengal. The dispute centered on whether the sales were taxable in Orissa and whether the assessment was based on mere agreements to sell.","The High Court incorrectly interpreted the Orissa Sales Tax Act, particularly section 2(g) regarding the definition of 'sale' and its proviso. The Supreme Court clarified that the proviso only fixed the location of the sale in Orissa if the goods were present there when the contract was made, not that it taxed mere agreements to sell. The court distinguished this case from Budh Prakash Jai Prakash, which dealt with taxing forward contracts, and found that the assessment was based on completed sales, not just agreements.","The Supreme Court concluded that the High Court's reference was based on a misapprehension of the facts and the law; therefore, the appeal was allowed, implying the assessment was valid."

Venkatarama Aiyar, J. 
1. This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Patna in a reference under section
66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The respondent is a firm and was the owner of a colliery at
a place called Bhurangya. On the 16th March, 1946, it entered into an agreement to sell the colliery,
lands, super- structures, machinery and fixtures to a company called Bhurangya Coal Co. Ltd., for a
consideration of Rs. 6,10,000. There is a schedule attached to the deed of agreement and thereunder
are set out in great detail all the properties which are the subject-matter of the agreement. It
consists of two parts; the first part includes land, building and the structures and the second part
consists of movables including machinery, trucks, pipes, motor cars and the like. The value of the
property mentioned in part I is fixed at Rs. 2,00,600 and that of the properties described in the
second part at Rs. 4,09,400. It is recited in the agreement that the properties mentioned in the
second part are capable o being transferred by delivery. It may be mentioned that the Bhurangya
Coal Co. Ltd. was incorporated only on the 18th March, 1946. But two of the promoters of the
company signed the agreement dated the 16th march, 1946, as representing the company. After","The Commissioner of Income-Tax appealed against the Patna High Court's judgment regarding the taxability of profits from the sale of a colliery by Bhurangya Coal Co. The dispute centered on whether profits from the sale of both movable and immovable properties of the colliery were subject to income tax under Section 12B of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, which came into force on April 1, 1946.","The court analyzed Section 12B of the Indian Income-tax Act, determining that profits from the sale of immovable properties (transferred via sale deed on May 17, 1946) were taxable, while profits from the sale of movable properties (delivered on March 30, 1946) were not. The court also considered the Transfer of Property Act and the Sale of Goods Act in determining when the title to movable and immovable properties passed. The court construed the sale deed and agreement to sell to determine the intention of the parties regarding the sale of fixtures.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Tribunal's decision that only profits from the sale of immovable properties described in part 1 of the schedule were liable to tax under Section 12B."

The court referenced precedents related to freedom of the press and reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights. The court interpreted Section 9(1) to require the Wage Board to consider the newspaper industry's capacity to pay, which it found the Board had failed to do.","The court upheld the constitutional validity of the Act with the exception of Section 5(1)(a)(iii), which was declared ultra vires, and declared the Wage Board's decision void and inoperative due to its failure to consider the industry's capacity to pay."

Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.*, which established that the term ""sale of goods"" in Entry 48 of List II has the same meaning as in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, and that building contracts do not involve a sale of materials. The court interpreted Rule 33 of the General Conditions of Contracts as ensuring the quality of materials rather than constituting a sale.","The petition was allowed, and a writ of prohibition was issued restraining the respondents from assessing tax on the materials supplied by the petitioners in construction contracts."

Sundararamier & Co., Madras-based yarn dealers, were challenged by the State of Andhra Pradesh for sales tax on yarn sold to Andhra dealers, where the contracts were concluded in Madras but the goods were delivered in Andhra for consumption. The dispute centered on whether Andhra could tax these inter-state sales, especially after the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956, which aimed to validate state laws taxing inter-state sales.","The court analyzed the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, particularly Section 22, in conjunction with Article 286 of the Constitution and the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956. It considered whether Section 22 imposed a tax on sales covered by the Explanation to Article 286(1)(a) and if the Validation Act could retroactively validate such a tax. The court also examined the scope of Parliament's power under Article 286(2) to lift the ban on inter-state sales taxation and the validity of the President's Adaptation Order under Article 372(2).","The court held that Section 22 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act did impose a conditional tax on the sales in question and that the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956, effectively validated this tax.

The State Of Madras vs Gannon Dunkerley & Co.,(Madras) Ltd on 1 April, 1958
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14253","The State of Madras sought to levy sales tax on Gannon Dunkerley & Co., a construction company, including the value of materials used in building contracts within their taxable turnover. Gannon Dunkerley challenged the assessment, arguing that the Madras Legislature lacked the power to tax the value of materials used in construction works as there was no sale of goods involved. The core dispute revolves around whether the supply of materials in a construction contract constitutes a 'sale of goods' under the Madras General Sales Tax Act.","The court analyzed the meaning of 'sale of goods' under Entry 48 of List II in Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, 1935, comparing it to the definition in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The court relied on precedents like Poppatlal Shah v. The State of Madras and The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. The court held that 'sale of goods' must involve an agreement for the sale of the very goods in which property eventually passes, and that a building contract is an indivisible agreement for work, not a sale of materials.","The appeal was related to the validity of the assessment under the Madras General Sales Tax Act. The court held that it was not within the competence of the Provincial Legislature to impose a tax on the supply of materials used in a building contract, treating it as a sale."

","The Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. appealed against sales tax assessments levied by the State of Bihar under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The dispute centered on deductions claimed by Tata Steel for goods manufactured in Bihar but sold and consumed outside the state, as well as deductions for railway freight. Tata Steel argued that the tax was an excise duty and that the theory of territorial nexus was inapplicable.","The court analyzed Section 4(1) read with Section 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as amended, to determine if the tax was within the legislative competence of the Bihar Legislature. The court held that the amendment did not extend the meaning of 'sale' to include a contract of sale, but rather located the situs of the sale. The court also applied the theory of territorial nexus, finding a sufficient connection between the taxing province and the sale due to the presence of goods in Bihar at the time of agreement or their manufacture there. Several precedents, including State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd., were relied upon.","The appeals by Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. were dismissed, upholding the validity of the sales tax assessment by the State of Bihar."

Rathod & Co., manufacturers of perfumery and hair oils in Ratlam (a Part B State), regarding the place of accrual or receipt of profits from goods sold to customers in Part A and C States. The dispute centered on whether the sales were effected and payments received in Part A/C States or in Ratlam, impacting the applicable tax rates. The goods were sent either by Value Payable Post (VPP) or by rail with railway receipts sent through a bank for payment.","The court analyzed the nature of VPP and railway receipt transactions under the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, specifically Section 25(1), and the Indian Contract Act, 1872, Section 148. It held that in VPP, the post office acts as the seller's agent for recovering the price, and the seller retains control until payment. For railway receipts, appropriation is conditional until payment is received by the bank. The court cited *Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. The Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax* and *Mothi Rungaya Chetty v. The Secretary of State for India* among other cases.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part, holding that payments received against railway receipts were received in Part A or C states, while reversing the High Court's decision regarding VPP transactions, finding that payments were also received in Part A or C states."

JUDGMENT
 Kapur, J. 
1. These five appeals pursuant to special leave are directed against the order of the Income-tax
Appellate Tribunal by which five appeals before it, two in regard to income-tax assessment for
1947-48 and 1948-49 and the other three against business profits tax assessment for the three
chargeable accounting periods covered by the same accounting periods, were disposed of. By the
Income-tax Officer and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the matter was decided in the
income-tax assessment appeal relating to the year of assessment 1947-48. The question in all these
appeals is common and it relates to depreciation under section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act
(hereinafter termed the Act.) The appellant before us is the Jogta Coal Co. and the respondent, the
Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal. The appellant company was incorporated on September
14, 1945.
2. The facts leading up to these appeals are that two brothers E. C. Agabeg and A. A. Agabeg were
lessees of a coal mine situate in village Jogta in the Jharia coal field area which belonged to the Raja
of Jharia. The two brothers installed on the land leased to them plant and machinery and erected
buildings and inclines and started working the coal mine. On April 10, 1935, the two brothers
const","Jogta Coal Co. Ltd. appealed against the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal's order regarding income-tax and business profits tax assessments for 1947-48 and 1948-49. The dispute concerned the amount on which the appellant was entitled to calculate deduction allowance for depreciation under section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act, specifically regarding the valuation of assets purchased during the acquisition of a coal mine.","The court analyzed section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act, focusing on the phrase ""on the original cost thereof to the assessee."" The court considered whether the Appellate Tribunal had the jurisdiction to disregard the price the appellant actually paid for the assets and to allocate a portion of the price to goodwill, even though the sale deed did not explicitly mention it. The court also considered precedents regarding the valuation of assets in business acquisitions.",The court determined that two questions of law arose from the Appellate Tribunal's order and that a reference should have been made to the High Court. The specific outcome of the appeal is not available in the truncated document.

1. This batch of three connected appeals raises the question whether and to what extent the activities
of the Corporation of the City of Nagpur come under the definition of ""industry"" in s. 2(14) of the
C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947 (hereinafter called the Act).
2. The appellant is the corporation of the City of Nagpur constituted under the City of Nagpur
Corporation Act, 1948 (Madhya Pradesh Act No. 2 of 1950). Disputes arose between the corporation
and the employees in various departments of the corporation in respect of wage scales, gratuity,
provident fund, house rent, confirmation, allowances etc. The Government of the State of Madhya
Pradesh by its order dated October 23, 1956, referred the said disputes under s. 39 of the Act to the
state industrial Court, Nagpur and the reference was numbered as Industrial Reference No. 18 of
1956. The appellant filed a state October 23, 1956, referred the said disputes under s. 39 of the Act to

Precedents like D. N. Banerji v. P. K. Mukherjee and Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen were cited to establish that municipal undertakings could be considered industries. The court also considered the rule of construction 'noscuntur a sociis' but determined that the wider words in the definition were deliberately used to broaden its scope.","The High Court remanded the case to the State Industrial Court to decide which departments of the Corporation fell within the definition of ""industry"" under the Act and to re-examine the schedules and categories of persons and to restrict the award to the persons concerned within the definition of the word ""industry"" in the Act."

The dealer had collected Rs. 2,11,222-9-6 as sales tax on goods worth Rs. 92,24,386-1-6 despatched outside Bihar, which the Superintendent of Sales Tax deemed a contravention of Section 14A of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The jute mills challenged the forfeiture order, arguing it was unconstitutional.","The court analyzed Section 14A of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and Rule 19 of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules, considering whether the dealer contravened the conditions and restrictions prescribed therein. The court cited State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. [1953] S.C.R. 1069, emphasizing that sales outside the state were outside the scope of the Act and not subject to tax. The court determined that the turnover in question was not an allowable deduction within the meaning of the proviso to Rule 19, as allowable deductions are based on Sections 6, 7, and 8 of the Act, not Section 33(1)(a)(1).","The preliminary objection prevailed, and the court found that the proviso to S. 14A was not attracted; therefore, the order of forfeiture passed against the respondent was unjustified and illegal."

JUDGMENT 1961 AIR 1183 With Civil Appeal Nos. 791 and 792 of 1957 and 3 of 1960 The Judgment
was delivered by SHAH, J. :
SHAH, J. - In these six appeals, the constitutional validity of section 2(g) of the Bihar
Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act XIX of 1947), as amended by the Bihar Sales Tax
(Amendment) Act, 1949 (Act VI of 1949), is challenged.
To appreciate the grounds on which the contention is raised by the appellants, it is
necessary to set out the legislative provisions applicable to the sales in respect of
which tax was sought to be levied by the State of Bihar under the Bihar Sales Tax Act,
1947. In exercise of the legislative power conferred by entry 48 in List II of the
Government of India Act, 1935, the Legislature of the Province of Bihar enacted the
Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act XIX of 1947, which was brought into operation on July
1, 1947. The Act was amended by the Bihar Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1949 (Act of
VI of 1949). Section 4(1) of the Act (which is the charging section) as amended,
provided, is so far as it is mater","Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd. challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as amended in 1949, which defined 'sale' and determined the situs of sale for taxation purposes. The dispute arose from the inclusion of sales of goods despatched outside Bihar in the taxable turnover of the company, which manufactured sugar in Bihar. The company argued that sales outside Bihar should not be subject to Bihar sales tax.","The court relied on the precedent set in Tata Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. v. The State of Bihar, which upheld the legislative competence of the Bihar State Legislature to enact section 2(g). The court interpreted the second proviso of section 2(g) as not extending the definition of 'sale' but rather locating the 'sale' in Bihar under certain circumstances, such as the goods being present in Bihar at the time of the contract or being manufactured there. The court found a sufficient nexus between the taxing state (Bihar) and the sale due to the presence or production of goods in Bihar.","The judgment text is incomplete, so the final outcome of the appeal is Not available in document."

The dispute centered on whether sales where goods were delivered outside Bihar for consumption outside Bihar were exempt from tax under Article 286(1)(a) of the Constitution. The appellant contended that all such sales, regardless of whether consumption occurred in the first destination state, were outside sales and thus exempt.","The court analyzed Article 286(1)(a) of the Constitution and its Explanation, considering precedents like The State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd. and Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. The State of Bihar. The court interpreted the Explanation to mean that only sales where delivery in the first destination state was for consumption therein qualified as ""outside sales"" exempt from Bihar's tax. Sales where goods were delivered outside Bihar but not for consumption in the first destination state were not considered ""Explanation Sales"" and remained taxable by Bihar.","The appeal was partially allowed. The court held that sales where delivery in the first destination state was for consumption there were exempt, and the case was remanded for reassessment accordingly; however, sales where delivery in the first destination state was not for consumption there were not exempt."

1. This is a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution for the issue of a wait of mandamus or a writ in
the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate direction, order or writ to direct the respondent,
the Union of India, to the withdraw or cancel the notification dated August 31, 1957, recognising
""the Stock Exchanges, Bombay"" under section 4 of the securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956
(XLII of 1956), (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"").
2. At the outset it is necessary to notice briefly how a stock Exchange is worked and how it is
controlled or regulated by the State. ""Stock Exchange"" means, ""any body of individuals, whether
incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting or controlling the business of buying,
selling or deal in securities"". The history of stock exchanges in foreign countries as well as India
shows that the development of joint stock enterprise would never have reached its present stage but
for the facilities which the stock exchanges provided for dealing in securities. They have a very
important function to fulfil in the country's economy. Their main function, in the words of an
eminent writer, is ""to liquify capital by enabling a person who has invested money in, say, a factory

The petitioner, a member of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited, claimed the notification imposed unreasonable restrictions on his right to carry on business in shares and discriminated against certain members. The case revolves around the regulation of stock exchanges and the validity of the government's notification in that context.","The petitioner argued that the notification violated Article 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry on business) and Article 14 (equality before the law) of the Constitution. The court considered whether the notification, being a 'law' under Article 13(2), could be challenged for infringing fundamental rights, even if the parent Act was not challenged. The court examined the scope of Section 4 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, and the conditions imposed in the notification for recognizing the stock exchange.",Not available in document

","M/S Damodar Valley Corporation was assessed sales tax under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, on machinery and equipment supplied to contractor firms for dam construction. The agreement stipulated contractors would pay for the equipment, which would remain the Corporation's property until paid, with an option for the Corporation to repurchase it at residual value. The dispute centered on whether this transaction constituted a 'sale' under the Act.","The High Court applied Section 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, determining whether the transaction was a sale or a hire. The court used a two-fold test: whether the hirer is obligated to purchase and whether they have the right to return the goods. Citing Helby v. Matthews, the court emphasized examining the substance of the agreement, not just its description. The court concluded the agreement was a sale on deferred payments with an option to repurchase, not a mere contract of hiring.","The High Court answered the referred question in the affirmative, holding that the transaction amounted to a sale within the meaning of s. 2(g) of the Act, and the appeal was dismissed."

No.  1  Sridhar brought ","Radhakisan Laxminarayan Toshniwal (appellant) was sued by Shridhar Ramchandra Alshi (respondent) for pre-emption of a survey number in Berar. The respondent claimed a right of pre-emption based on co-occupancy after the vendors entered into contracts of sale with the appellant and executed a lease. The core dispute revolves around whether the transactions constituted a sale subject to pre-emption under the Berar Land Revenue Code, 1928, and whether the appellant fraudulently avoided executing a registered sale deed to defeat the pre-emption right.","The court analyzed the Berar Land Revenue Code, 1928, particularly sections related to pre-emption rights arising from sales, usufructuary mortgages, and leases. It considered the application of the Transfer of Property Act to Berar, emphasizing that a valid sale requires a registered instrument under Section 54. The court referenced precedents like *Immudipattam Thirugnana S. O. Kondema Naik v. Peria Dorasami* to reinforce the necessity of a registered instrument for property transfer. The court held that the contract of sale did not create an interest in favor of the appellant, and no right to enforce pre-emption arose until a valid transfer was completed.","The appeal was allowed. The court found that the right of pre-emption had not accrued to the respondent because a valid sale, requiring a registered instrument, had not been completed."

The taxing authorities in West Bengal had to ascertain whether the goods were in movement from Bihar to West Bengal at the time of transfer and whether the sale was effected within West Bengal under S. 4, cl. (2).","The court held that the West Bengal taxing authorities had to ascertain specific conditions before ordering payment of tax under the Central Sales Tax Act. The petition was regarding the authority of the Commercial Tax Officer, Lyons Range, Calcutta, to demand payment of tax; the final outcome of the petition itself (allowed/dismissed) is not explicitly stated in the provided text."

The Act levied a tax on 'forward contracts,' defined as agreements for the sale of goods on a future date where actual delivery doesn't occur, but only the price difference is paid. The appellants contended the Act was ultra vires.","The court analyzed whether the Act fell under Entry 62 of the State List (taxes on betting and gambling). The court found that the definition of 'forward contract' in the Act did not necessarily equate to a wagering contract, as it lacked the element of intent not to deliver goods. The court relied on R. M. D. Chamarbaugwala v. The Union of India, [1957] S. C. R. 93o. Even if the definition was broad enough to include some wagering contracts, the valid portion would be too small to save the entire Act.","The appeal was allowed, and the Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act, 1951, was held invalid due to the State Legislature's lack of competence."

JUDGMENT
Hidayatullah, J.
1. This appeal, by special leave of this Court, is against the judgment and order dated March 24,
1955, of the Punjab High Court by which the High Court, purporting to act under section 66(4) of
the Indian Income-tax Act, called for a supplemental statement of the case from the Income-tax
Appellate Tribunal. The special leave granted by this court is limited to the question whether the
High Court had jurisdiction in this case to call for the supplemental statement.
2. The assessee, Messrs. S. Zoraster & Co., Jaipur, consists of three partners. Two of them are
coparceners of a joint Hindu family, and the third is a stranger. They had formed this partnership in
June, 1940, for the manufacture and sale of blankets, felts and other woollen articles. A deed of
partnership was also executed on March 16, 1944. The assessee entered in to contracts with the
Government for the supply of goods, and in the assessment year 1942-43, Rs. 10,80,658-0-0 and in
the assessment year 1943-44, Rs. 17,45,336-0-0 were assessed as its income by the Income-tax
Officer, Contractor's Circle, New Delhi. The supplies to Government were made for Jaipur by the
assessee, and payment was by ch","Messrs. S. Zoraster & Co., a partnership firm, appealed against a Punjab High Court order that called for a supplemental statement from the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal regarding the firm's income assessment for sales made to the Government of India. The dispute centers on whether the profits from these sales were received by the assessee within taxable territories, specifically concerning the receipt of government cheques in Jaipur. The product involved is blankets, felts, and other woolen articles manufactured and sold by the assessee.","The court analyzed Section 66(4) of the Indian Income-tax Act, which pertains to the High Court's jurisdiction to call for supplemental statements from the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The court cited precedents like New Jehangir Vakil Mills Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, and Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ogale Class Works Ltd. to determine the limits of the High Court's jurisdiction under Section 66(4), emphasizing that the High Court cannot raise new questions of law or order fresh inquiries into new facts not arising from the Tribunal's order.","The appeal was allowed, as the Supreme Court found that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction by calling for a supplemental statement on a matter not initially considered by the Tribunal."

The companies argued that the sales were exempt from taxation under Article 286(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, claiming the sales occurred outside West Bengal and were in the course of export.","The court analyzed Article 286(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, focusing on the meaning of 'sale outside the State' and 'export'. It held that for Article 286(1)(a) to apply, another state must be identified where the goods were delivered for consumption. The court also clarified that 'export' in Article 286(1)(b) requires a foreign destination where the goods are imported, not merely taken out of the country. Precedents like State of Travancore-Cockin v. The Bombay Co. Ltd. were relied upon.","The appeals were dismissed, with the court holding that the sales were made within the State of West Bengal and did not qualify as exports under Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution."

Carl Still challenged the tax proceedings, contending that it was an indivisible works contract, not a sale of goods.","The court analyzed the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, specifically sections defining 'sale,' 'contract,' 'goods,' 'sale price,' 'dealer,' and 'turnover,' along with Section 13(5) concerning tax assessment for dealers failing to register. The court relied on precedents like *The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.* and *Peare Lal Hari Singh v. The State of Punjab* to determine if the contract was a sale of materials or an indivisible works contract. The court interpreted the agreement as an indivisible works contract, not a contract of sale.","The appeals were allowed, and the proceedings initiated by the sales tax authorities were quashed, holding that the tax on materials supplied under the works contract was illegal."

The dispute centered on whether certain sales transactions with dealers outside Madras were inter-state sales and thus exempt from state sales tax under Article 286(2) of the Constitution, especially considering the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956.","The court analyzed the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956, particularly Section 2, to determine if it protected the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, from the restrictions imposed by Article 286(2) of the Constitution. The court relied on M. P. V. Sundararamier & Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Another, [1958] S.C.R. I422, and interpreted the Validation Act as liberating state laws from the fetter of Article 286(2), enabling them to operate on their own terms. The court also considered Section 2(h) and Section 3 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939.","The appeal was dismissed, holding that the transactions in question were liable to tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, due to the Validation Act's effect of removing the constitutional restriction on inter-state sales taxation."

Under Art. 286(1) it ","A. V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. appealed against the Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax's decision to levy sales tax on tea sales. The tea was stored in Travancore-Cochin, but auctioned in Madras, with delivery orders issued there, and the goods were then sent for consumption to other states or exported. The dispute centered on whether the sales were taxable in Travancore-Cochin or considered 'outside sales' due to the auction location.","The court analyzed Article 286(1)(a) of the Constitution of India and Section 64 of the Sale of Goods Act to determine where the sale took place. Citing Indian Copper Corporation Ltd. v. State of Bihar, the court emphasized that the 'passing of property within the State' is crucial for determining whether a sale is 'inside' or 'outside' the State. The court found that the property in the tea passed at Fort Cochin (Madras) upon the fall of the hammer, making it an outside sale for Travancore-Cochin.","The appeal was allowed, and the judgment and order of the Kerala High Court were set aside, meaning the sales tax levied by Travancore-Cochin was deemed invalid."

The sugar dispatches were made under the directions of the Sugar Controller, exercising powers under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1946. The appellant contended that these dispatches did not constitute sales and were therefore not subject to sales tax.","The court analyzed whether the transactions constituted a 'sale' under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, specifically section 2(g), which defines 'sale' as a transfer of property in goods for valuable consideration. The court referred to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, emphasizing that a contract of sale is a prerequisite for a sale. The court reasoned that the dispatches under the Controller's directions lacked the element of volition and mutual agreement necessary for a contract of sale, citing State of Madras v.

The State of Bihar levied sales tax on these transactions, which the appellant challenged, arguing that the sales were in the course of inter-State trade and thus not taxable under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, due to Article 286(2) of the Constitution.","The court analyzed whether the Sales Tax Continuance Order of 1950 authorized the tax levied by Bihar on inter-state sales before March 31, 1951. The court determined that the order only applied to taxes being lawfully levied immediately before the Constitution's commencement. The court found that the Bihar Sales Tax Act, as it stood before January 26, 1950, did not define 'sale' to include the inter-state sales in question, and therefore the tax was not lawfully levied before that date.","The appeal was allowed regarding the sales tax assessment between January 26, 1950, and March 31, 1951, as the Sales Tax Continuance Order, 1950 did not validate the tax collection for that period.

The dealer argued that these transactions were merely transfers of delivery orders, not actual sales.","The court considered whether the endorsement of delivery orders, leading to the ultimate holder taking delivery of goods, constituted a sale by the original endorser. The court referred to the principle laid down in Butterworth v. Kingway Motors Ltd. and Bayyana Bhimayya v.

The court emphasized that a delivery order is a document of title, and its transfer, coupled with the subsequent delivery of goods, represents a separate sale transaction.","The document does not explicitly state the final outcome of the appeals.

The companies argued that the sales were inter-state sales, as the cement was moved from factories outside Mysore into the state, and therefore not taxable under Mysore's sales tax laws. The core dispute revolves around whether the movement of goods was a result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale.","The court applied Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, which defines an inter-state sale as one that occasions the movement of goods from one state to another. Citing Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S.R. Sarkar, the court interpreted this to mean that the movement must be the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale. The court determined that the sales contracts, read in conjunction with the government-issued permits specifying supply from factories outside Mysore, implied a covenant for inter-state movement, thus classifying them as inter-state sales not taxable by the state.","The petitions were allowed, and the court directed the issuance of writs quashing the assessment orders and restraining the respondents from levying or collecting tax on the disputed sales."

The second appellant was a manufacturer of cement and at the
material  time  it had over a dozen factories  in  different
parts  of  India none of which was in the State  of  Mysore.
The  first appellant was its sales manager and had its  head
office  in Bombay with a branch office at Bangalore  in  the
State of Mysore' Cement wa","The Cement Marketing Co. Ltd. and Associated Cement Co. Ltd. appealed against the State of Mysore's sales tax assessment on cement sales. The Cement Marketing Co., as sales manager for Associated Cement, sold cement manufactured outside Mysore to purchasers within the state. The dispute centered on whether these sales were intrastate (taxable by Mysore) or interstate (protected under Article 286(2) of the Constitution).","The court analyzed Article 286(2) of the Constitution, which prohibits states from taxing sales occurring in the course of interstate trade or commerce. The court relied on precedents like M/S. Mohan Lai Hargobind v. The State of Madhya Pradesh to determine that sales involving the movement of goods from one state to another as a result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale fall under Article 286(2). The court found that the cement sales were indeed interstate transactions.","The appeal was allowed, and the imposition of sales tax on the cement sales by the State of Mysore was deemed unconstitutional."

The court distinguished between an agreed-upon purchase option and a compulsory acquisition.","The appeal was dismissed, with the court holding that the transaction was a sale within the meaning of Section 10(2)(vii) of the Income-tax Act, and therefore the excess amount was taxable."

The court held that Section 43 applies to all transfers fulfilling its conditions, regardless of whether the defect in title arises from a lack of interest or an expectant heir's interest. The court also clarified the relationship between Section 43 and Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, stating that Section 43 embodies a rule of estoppel which is one of evidence, while Section 6(a) enacts a rule of substantive law.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the prior sale was valid under Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act, thus prevailing over the subsequent release deed."

JUDGMENT
Raghubar Dayal, J.
1. The facts giving rise to this appeal, by special leave, are these :
The Dominion of India, as the owner of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway,
represented by the General Manager of that railway, invited tenders for the supply of
jaggery to the railway grain shops. The respondent submitted his tender for the
supply of 14,000 imperial maunds of cane jaggery during the months of February and
March 1948. The tender form contained a note in paragraph 2 which was meant for
the quantity required and the described dates of delivery. This note was :
""This Administration reserves the right to cancel the contract at any stage during the
tenure of the contract without calling up the outstandings on the unexpired portion
of the contract.""
2. The Deputy General Manager of the Railways, by his letter dated January 29, 1948, accepted this
tender. The letter asked the respondent to remit a sum of Rs. 7,900/- for security and said that on
receipt of the remittance, official order would be placed with the respondent. In his letter dated
February 16, 1948, the Deputy General Manager reiterated the acceptance of the tender subject to
the respondent's acceptance of the terms and conditions printed on the reverse of that letter. Among
these terms, the terms of delivery stated : Progr","The Union of India, representing the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, appealed a High Court decision regarding a contract for the supply of jaggery. The Railway had accepted Maddala Thathiah's tender to supply 14,000 maunds of jaggery but later cancelled the contract for the outstanding balance, citing a clause allowing cancellation at any stage. Thathiah sued for breach of contract, and the High Court found the cancellation clause void.","The Supreme Court analyzed the terms of the contract, specifically the cancellation clause, in the context of the tender and subsequent order. The Court interpreted the clause as applying only to the initial agreement for supply, not to specific orders placed for definite quantities and delivery dates. The Court reasoned that once a formal order was placed, it constituted a binding contract, and the cancellation clause did not apply to those specific orders.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the High Court's decision that the cancellation clause was not applicable to the formal order placed for the jaggery supply. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine the damages owed to Maddala Thathiah."

Court was whether the charge ""security deposit"" amounted  to
a trading recei","The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Punjab, appealed against Punjab Distilling Industries Ltd. regarding the assessment of ""empty bottles return security deposits"" as trading receipts under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The distiller collected these deposits from customers, refundable upon the return of bottles, and the dispute centered on whether these deposits constituted taxable income.","The court relied on its previous judgment in Punjab Distilling Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, holding that the security deposits were an integral part of the commercial transaction and represented an extra price charged for the bottles. The court distinguished the case from Davies v. Shell Company of China Ltd. and K.M.S. Lakshmanier & Sons v. Commissioner of Incometax and Excess Profits Tax, Madras, emphasizing that the amounts were part of the sale consideration.","The appeals were allowed, affirming that the ""security deposits"" were trading receipts and therefore income of the assessee assessable to tax."

The dispute centered on whether the packing material used in the redrying process was subject to sales tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. The government argued that the transfer of packing material to customers constituted a sale.","The court analyzed Section 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, which defines 'sale' as the transfer of property in goods for consideration. The majority opinion held that for a sale to be taxable as part of a works contract, there must be an express or implied contract for the sale of the goods themselves, not merely an incidental transfer of title. The court reviewed case law to support this interpretation.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the packing material was an integral part of the redrying process and not subject to sales tax, as there was no independent contract for its sale."

Johar and Company, a financing company, was assessed sales tax by the Madras sales tax authorities on hire-purchase transactions of motor vehicles, treating them as sales under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. The company challenged the assessment, arguing that it was merely a financing agent, the explanation including hire-purchase agreements as sales was ultra vires, and the sale only occurred upon exercising the purchase option.","The court analyzed Explanation 1 to Section 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, in light of the definition of 'sale' under the Sale of Goods Act. Citing Sales Tax Officer v. M/s. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash and State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co., the court held that the State Legislature could only tax a 'sale' as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, where property passes from seller to buyer. Since hire-purchase agreements do not immediately transfer property, Explanation 1 was deemed beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature.","The court held Explanation 1 to be invalid. The appeals were allowed in part, determining that sales tax was only exigible when the option to purchase was exercised, and the price had to be worked out fairly, considering the depreciation of the vehicle."

The court rejected the argument that the sale was a conditional sale completed only upon acceptance of the goods in Willingdon Island. Precedents like A. V. Thomas & Co.

The respondent initially had imperfect title, and the appellant sought to compel him to sell the entire house after the respondent perfected his title following his mother's death. The dispute centered on whether Section 18(a) of the Specific Relief Act applied.","The court analyzed Section 18(a) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, interpreting the phrase 'subsequently to the sale or lease' to mean 'subsequently to the contract to sell or let,' citing Kalyanpur Lime Works Ltd. v. State of Bihar as precedent. The court reasoned that restricting the application of Section 18(a) to cases where an actual sale or lease had taken place would be incorrect and lead to overlap with Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that the High Court was wrong in not applying Section 18(a) of the Specific Relief Act to the facts of the case."

1. These appeals have been filed with certificates granted by the High Court of Assam under Art. 132
of the Constitution against orders passed in certain petitions filed by the appellants praying for writs
of certiorari or other appropriate writs quashing orders relating to assessment of sales-tax, and
prohibiting the Superintendent of Taxes, Dhubri and other officers from taking action in
enforcement of the said orders. The appeals raise common questions and may be disposed of by a
common judgment.
2. The appellants are merchants carrying on business as dealers in jute, and have their principal
place of business at Calcutta. The appellants have a branch office at Dhubri in the State of Assam
and the registered dealers under the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947 (17 of 1947). The appellants
purchased jute at Dhubri and other places in the State of Assam and despatched bales of jute to
diverse factories outside the Province of Assam. The appellants submitted returns of turnout for
purposes of sales-tax before the Superintendent of Taxes, Dhubri, under the Assam Sales Tax Act in
respect of transactions of sale during the period between March","Thansingh Nathmal and others, jute merchants with a branch in Assam, appealed against orders assessing sales tax under the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947. They contested the Superintendent of Taxes' assessment, arguing that the tax was levied on sales outside the state and constituted an export tax, also disputing whether the goods were actually within Assam at the time of the contracts.","The court analyzed the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947, particularly sections related to the definition of 'dealer' (s. 2(3)), 'sale' (s. 2(12)), the charging section (s. 3), assessment procedures (s. 17), and appeal/revision mechanisms (s. 30, 31, 32). The court considered the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935, regarding the Explanation to s. 2(12). The court emphasized that factual determinations are the domain of the taxing authorities, and the High Court's role is limited to questions of law arising from their decisions.","The appeals were dismissed, with the court refusing to grant leave to appeal on grounds other than the constitutional questions for which the certificates were granted by the High Court."

held  that the rebate was not admissible ","Amritsar Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. appealed against the Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P.'s decision to reject their claim for a rebate under Section 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948. The sugar mill sold sugar to parties within Uttar Pradesh, but the sugar was dispatched to locations outside the state based on buyer instructions. The dispute centered on whether these sales qualified for a rebate as ""sales for delivery outside the State.""","The court analyzed Section 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948, focusing on the meaning of 'delivery' in the context of export sales and rebates. It disapproved of the Lord Krishna Sugar Mills precedent and approved the India Coffee and Tea distributing Co. Ltd. v. The State of Madras case. The court interpreted 'delivery' to mean 'actual delivery' to encourage exports, and determined that the despatch instructions were part of the contract, contemplating a destination outside Uttar Pradesh.","The appeals were allowed, as the court found that the sales by the assessee were for actual delivery outside Uttar Pradesh and thus qualified for the rebate."

1. These appeals are brought by certificate from the judgment of the Calcutta High Court dated
August 1, 1962 by which an award of the arbitrator, Sir R.C. Mitter dated September 2, 1959 was set
aside.
2. The disputes arise out of two contracts being A.T. 1000 dated November 30, 1944 and A.T. 1048
dated June 25, 1945 between the Government of India (hereinafter called the ""Government"") and
the Bungo Steel Furniture Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter called the ""appellant""). Both the contracts contained
the usual arbitration clause embodied in clause 21 of the general conditions of contract in form no.
W.S.B. 133 for reference of any question or dispute arising in connection with the contract or arising
under the condition thereof. The claims and the counterclaims of the parties under the two contracts
were referred to the arbitration of Sir R.C. Mitter. The award of the arbitrator is dated September 2,
1959. The arbitrator found that the contract no. A.T. 1000 was for the supply of 4700 bins at Rs.
107/2/6 per bin inclusive of the price of steel. In respect of the supply of bins under this contract the
Government agreed to pay an extra Rs. 4/12/6 per bin for extra partition. The contract no. A.T. 1048

arbitr","Bungo Steel Furniture Pvt. Ltd. and the Union of India (Government) were in dispute over two contracts for the supply of steel bins. The Government cancelled the contract for the remaining bins, and Bungo Steel claimed damages for wrongful termination. The arbitrator awarded compensation based on the value of steel used in unfinished bins, which the Government challenged.","The court analyzed Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act and Section 56 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act to determine the correct measure of damages for breach of contract and non-acceptance of goods. The court found that the arbitrator erred in awarding damages based solely on the value of steel used, instead of considering the difference between contract price and market price or manufacturing cost. The court cited Champsey Bhara and Company v. Jivraj Balloo spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. regarding errors of law on the face of the award.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision to set aside the arbitrator's award due to an error of law apparent on the face of the award regarding the calculation of damages."

Act   of   State-Contract   with   former   Indian    State-
Enforceability after merger against successor State.
HEADNOTE:
The   former  State  of  Bharatpur  sold  some   plots   for
establishing  a  Mandi,  and the appellant was  one  of  the
purchasers.   Under the terms of the sale, a person  trading
in  the Mandi would get a reduction of 25 % in  the  customs
duty  payable,  if  the commodities were  imported  into  or
exported out of the State through the Mandi.  The Government
of  Bharatpur  and after its merger the  Government  of  the
United   State  of  Matsya,  and  thereafter,  the   present

Rajasthan State (respondent herein) allowed the reduction to
the  appellant,  who  was  also  a  trader.   In  1951,  the
respondent  revoked the concession.  The appellant  filed  a
suit  for the recovery of the excess amount of customs  duty
paid  on  the  basis  that","Firm Bansidhar Premsukhdas sued the State of Rajasthan to recover excess customs duty paid. The firm claimed a 25% reduction in customs duty based on a notification issued by the former State of Bharatpur when the firm purchased plots in a Mandi. The State of Rajasthan revoked the concession, leading to the dispute over whether the successor state was bound by the former state's contractual obligations.","The court held that a succeeding sovereign state is only bound by the contractual liability of a former state if it recognizes that liability. The court found no express or implied recognition by the State of Rajasthan of the contractual right to the concession. Furthermore, the court stated that even if there was implied recognition, the Rajasthan (Regulation of Customs Duties) Ordinance No. 16 of 1949 superseded the previous contract.","The appeal was dismissed, with the court ruling against Firm Bansidhar Premsukhdas and in favor of the State of Rajasthan."

A dispute arose regarding the completion of the sale, with the sellers claiming the buyer failed to meet deadlines and the buyer seeking specific performance of the agreement. The core issue revolves around whether time was of the essence in the contract and the buyer's readiness and willingness to perform his part.","The court analyzed Section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872, regarding the importance of stipulated time in contracts. Precedents like Jamshed Khodaram Irani v. Burjorji Dhunjibhai and Stickney v. Keeble were referenced to determine if time was of the essence. The court interpreted that the agreements did not explicitly state time was essential, and the respondent's readiness and willingness to perform the contract was questioned.",The High Court's decision decreeing specific performance was reversed. The appeal was allowed because the respondent was found not to be continuously ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.

Majid & Co. claimed Gordon Woodroffe was their agent and sought an account of their dealings, alleging a balance due and losses from un-shipped goods.","The court distinguished between a contract of sale and a contract of agency, emphasizing that a sale involves the transfer of title for a price, while agency involves selling goods as the principal's property and accounting for the proceeds. The court analyzed the contract terms and the course of dealings, concluding that the contracts indicated an outright purchase rather than an agency agreement. The court cited Bishnu Chand v.

The dispute arose when the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes assessed sales tax on these supplies, arguing they were intra-state sales, while K.G. Khosla claimed they were sales in the course of import and thus exempt from taxation.","The court analyzed Section 5(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, which defines when a sale is deemed to occur in the course of import. The court cited Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar and other cases. The court held that the High Court wrongly interpreted the section to mean that the sale must precede the import, clarifying that the movement of goods from Belgium to India was in pursuance of the contract, making the sales exempt from taxation.","The appeals were allowed, and the sales were deemed to have taken place in the course of import, thus exempting them from taxation."

I.D. Dua, J.  
(1) These two letters Patent Appeals (Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 26-D and 27-D of 1964) arise out of
the same proceedings and being directed against one main judgment of a learned Single Judge, may
be disposed of by one judgment. The only question falling for our determination relates to the plea
of limitation and lies within a narrow compass, namely, whether Article 97 of the Limitation Act
applies to the case or whether it is governed by the residuary Article 120, no other Article being
applicable in terms. Of course at one stage Shri hardy learned Counsel for the respondents also
attempted to apply Article 62 of the Limitation Act but this attempt was not seriously persisted in.
(2) Turning now to the facts on 26-11-1946, Messrs. Gokal Nagar Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (Hereafter
called the vendor Company) entered into an agreement to sell the building in question situated in
Lahore (now in West Pakistan) for a consideration of Rs.1,35,000/- to Shri Ram Lal Puri
(hereinafter called the vendee) who paid Rs.20,000/- by way of earnest money at the time of the
agreement. The sale was to be completed by 5-4-1947. On 1-4-1947, the vendee sought extension of
time for the completion of the sale upto 20-4-1947, to which the vendor company agreed. On
17-4-1947, the vendee paid Rs.30,000 as an additional advance seeking extension of time by another
month ","Ram Lal Puri (vendee) sued Gokalnagar Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (vendor) to recover money paid as earnest money and additional advance for a building sale agreement that failed due to the partition of India. The dispute centers around which article of the Limitation Act applies to the claim, determining whether the claim is time-barred. The product involved is a building in Lahore, and the grievance is the vendor's refusal to return the money after the sale fell through.","The court analyzed whether Article 97 (money paid upon failure of consideration) or Article 120 (residuary article) of the Limitation Act applied. The court distinguished between earnest money and advance payment, finding Article 97 inapplicable to the earnest money. The court considered Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act regarding restoration of advantage when a contract becomes void. Ultimately, the court concluded that Article 120 applied to the earnest money claim.","The Letters Patent Appeals were allowed in part. The vendee's claim for the earnest money of Rs. 20,000 was held to be within time and decreed, while the claim for the additional advance of Rs. 30,000 was held to be time-barred."

It cited *Lala Durga Prasad v. Lala Deep Chand* and other cases.

The dispute centers on whether the respondents were the 'last dealers' liable for sales tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act.","The court analyzed Rule 4A(iv)(b) of the Madras General Sales-tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939, focusing on who 'buys it in the State'.

JUDGMENT  
  Tatachari, J.    
(1) This letters patent appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the High Court of Punjab
originally came up for hearing before a Division Bench of the High Court (S.S. Dulat and S.K. Kapur,
JJ). The learned Judges took the view that the case involved a question of limitation which should
be decided by a larger Bench. The Appeal, has, therefore, been posted before us.
The appellant, M/s. Bhajan Singh Hardat Singh and Co., filed a suit No. 718 of 1954 in the Court of
Shri Munnilal Jain, P.C. S., Sub-Judge, 1st Class, Delhi, for recovery of Rs.3392/9/6 from the
respondents , herein Karson Agency (India) and another who were impleaded as defendants in the
said suit.
(2) The case of the appellant-plaintiff was:
(a) That on 14-2-51, the respondents defendants agreed at Delhi to purchase from the
appellant ""500 Yards of worsted (Woolen cloth) of Indian Woolen Mills, steel colour,
June - July, Challan at Rs.23/4/ per yard and paid Rs.1,000/- as advance that on
25-7-1951, the respondents were sent a Bill (Ex. P-10) No. 5306, for 500 yards
worsted as per the contract, and were required to take delivery of the goods after
payment of Rs.10,625/- which was the balance amount due after deducting the
advance of Rs.1,000/- from the total amount of Rs.11,625/-, the price of the cloth as
per the contract, and that the res","Bhajan Singh Hardit Singh & Co. sued Karson Agency for recovery of money due to breach of contract for the sale of woolen cloth. Karson Agency failed to take delivery of the goods, leading Bhajan Singh to resell them and sue for the loss incurred. The central dispute revolves around the limitation period for filing the suit.","The core legal issue is whether Article 115 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, applies, setting a three-year limitation from the date of the contract breach, or if the cause of action arises from the date of resale of the goods. The court considered Section 54(2) of the Sale of Goods Act regarding the right of resale. The Chief Justice agreed with the decision of the High Court of Madras in Soundara Rajan and Co., v. K.P.A.T. Annamalai Nadar, holding that the starting point of limitation is the date the buyer refused to take delivery.","The Letters Patent Appeal was preferred against the judgment that dismissed the suit as barred by limitation. The court upheld the dismissal, finding the suit was indeed time-barred under Article 115 of the Limitation Act."

The assessee-company had transferred its cinema house and other assets in exchange for shares in another company, and the Income-tax Officer sought to tax the excess amount realized over the written-down value of the assets as profits from a sale. The dispute centered on whether the transaction was a 'sale' or an 'exchange'.","The court analyzed the definitions of 'sale' under the Transfer of Property Act and the Sale of Goods Act, emphasizing the requirement of a money consideration. It distinguished 'sale' from 'exchange,' where the consideration is not money but a reciprocal transfer of ownership. The court held that in the absence of bad faith or concealment, the taxing statute must be applied according to the legal rights of the parties, based on the language of the transaction document, citing Bank of Chettinad Ltd. v. C.I.T. Madras and other cases.","The court held that the transaction was an exchange, not a sale, and the Income-tax authorities were not entitled to treat it as a sale under s. 10(2)(vii) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; the appeal was dismissed."

The supplies were made at the direction of the Steel Controller under the Iron and Steel (Control of Production and Distribution) Order, 1941. The appellant contended that these transactions were not 'sales' as defined under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, because they were made under compulsion of law and lacked mutual agreement.","The court analyzed whether the transactions constituted 'sales' under Section 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, and Entry 54 of List II of the VII Schedule in the Constitution. It referred to the State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley case to define 'sale of goods' as having the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act 1930, requiring parties competent to contract, mutual assent, transfer of property, and a price in money.

Income-tax  Officer, by the Appellate Commissioner","Khan Bahadur Ahmed Alladin & Sons, an assessee firm, purchased a Brengun factory from the Government of India and subsequently sold the stores and part of the land and buildings at a higher price. The dispute arose regarding whether the profit from the sale of the land and buildings was a capital accretion or an adventure in the nature of trade, making it liable to income tax. The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Andhra Pradesh, assessed the profit as taxable income, which the assessee firm contested.","The court analyzed whether the transaction constituted an ""adventure in the nature of trade"" under Section 2(4) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (and corresponding provisions of the Hyderabad Income Tax Act). The court considered precedents like Venkataswami Naidu & Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, emphasizing that the decision depends on the total impression of all relevant facts and circumstances. The court determined that the question is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to challenge under Section 66(1) of the Indian Act.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the transaction was an adventure in the nature of trade and part of a profit-making scheme, making the profit liable to tax."

The dispute concerns whether the profits from these sales accrued in the Part 'B' State, entitling the appellant to tax concessions, or in Part 'A' and Part 'C' States.

contract on 29th March 1952.  On 21s","P.S.N.S. Ambalavana Chettiar And Co. (appellants) and Express Newspapers Ltd. (respondent) entered into a contract for the sale of newsprint. The dispute arose when the appellants refused to take delivery of the balance of the newsprint after a variation in the quantity agreed upon, and the respondent resold the goods, claiming the deficiency from the appellants. The core issue revolves around the validity of the resale and whether the property in the goods had passed to the appellants.","The court analyzed Section 54(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which grants the seller the right to resale only if the property in the goods has passed to the buyer subject to the unpaid seller's lien. Citing Section 18 of the same Act, the court emphasized that for unascertained goods, property transfer is contingent on ascertainment. The court determined that the variation in the contract transformed it from a sale of specific goods to a sale of unascertained goods, and since no appropriation occurred before the resale, the property had not passed, invalidating the resale under Section 54(2).","The appeal was allowed in part. While the resale was deemed invalid, the respondent was entitled to damages under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, representing the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date of repudiation."

After the Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act came into effect, the State prohibited him from cutting timber. Prasad sued for specific performance, arguing the trees didn't vest in the State or that a new contract was formed, but the State rejected his claims.","The court considered the Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, specifically sections related to the vesting of proprietary rights in the State. It cited precedents like Mahadeo v. State of Bombay and State of M.P. v. Yakinuddin, holding that the forest and trees vested in the State. The court also analyzed Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act, determining that the timber was not 'ascertained goods' and property hadn't passed to Prasad before vesting in the State. The court found no unconditional acceptance of a new contract due to a reservation in Prasad's letter.","The appeal was dismissed, meaning Badri Prasad's suit for specific performance failed, and he was not entitled to cut the trees or receive damages."

1. The respondent-hereinafter called 'the assessee'-has its Head Office at Calcutta and a Branch
Office at Jaipur, and is registered as a ""dealer"" under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954. Under a
contract dated September 2, 1948, with the Equitable Coal, Company the assessee acquired
monopoly rights to supply on behalf of the collieries, coal in certain areas including Rajasthan.
Under an agreement dated April 28, 1955, with the State of Rajasthan the assessee supplied coal to
the State Power Houses upto May 19, 1958. The Sales Tax Officer, City Circle A, Jaipur assessed to
tax the turnover of the assessee in the year 1955-56 from the supply of coal to the State of Rajasthan.
2. The assessee then moved a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of
Rajasthan for a writ quashing the order of assessment of the Sales Tax Officer. The High Court
accepted the plea that the assessee was not a dealer within the meaning of the Act and quashed the
assessment. In appeal by the State of Rajasthan against the order of the High Court, this Court held
that the assessee was a dealer within the meaning of the explanation to Section 2(f) of the Rajasthan
Sales Tax Act, since the assessee","The State of Rajasthan appealed against Karam Chand Thappar and Brothers (Coal Suppliers) regarding the assessment of sales tax on coal supplied to the State Power Houses. The assessee claimed they were not a dealer and that the sales were inter-state sales, challenging the Sales Tax Officer's assessment. The dispute centers around whether the supply of coal constituted a sale under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act and the applicability of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act.","The court considered whether the transaction met the criteria for a sale under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, referencing the Gannon Dunkerley case which requires competent parties, mutual assent, transfer of property, and price. The court distinguished this case from New India Sugar Mills Ltd., where mutual assent was absent, and cited Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. and Andhra Sugars Ltd. to support the view that statutory control over goods does not negate a contract of sale. The court found that all four elements of a sale existed, despite the Colliery Control Order.","The court found that the transaction was a sale of goods within the meaning of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act. The judgment was in favor of the State of Rajasthan, but the final outcome regarding the assessment amount is not available in the truncated document."

Sales Tax Act, determining that it applied to goods manufactured in U.P. regardless of where the sale contract was made. The court cited Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Bharat Sugar Mills v. The State of Bihar, establishing that a territorial nexus, such as manufacturing within the state, is sufficient for imposing sales tax. The court also held that the Commissioner had the power to apply for a reference even after the amending Act came into force, as it was a procedural matter.","The High Court's judgment was upheld, answering the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative, meaning the sales were taxable and the provision was not ultra vires. The appeals were dismissed."

JUDGMENT
V. Ramaswami, J.
1. The appellant is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and carries on business
of mining manganese ore and selling the same to various buyers in India. For the calendar year 1st
January, 1958, to 31st December, 1958, the appellant was assessed to sales tax under the C.P. and
Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (since repealed by the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958).
During the said period the appellant had sold manganese ore to eight different parties outside the
State of Madhya Pradesh under written contracts. It was contended on behalf of the appellant before
the sales tax authorities that these contracts occasioned movement of the sold goods from the State
of Madhya Pradesh to the State of Maharashtra so that all the sales were exempt from tax under the
C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and also under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958
(2 of 1959), which repealed the former. The Sales Tax Officer, Chhindwara, rejected the contention
of the appellant and assessed all the sales to tax by his order of assessment dated 5th April, 1960, on
a taxable turnover of Rs. 2,22,918 and odd. The appellant took the matter in appeal to the Appellate
Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax but his appeal was dismissed. T","Hanuman Mining Corporation Ltd. was assessed sales tax under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, for selling manganese ore to buyers outside Madhya Pradesh. The appellant contended that these sales were exempt from tax as they occasioned movement of goods from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra. The Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, challenged this, arguing the sales were intra-state.","The court analyzed Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, which defines inter-state sales as those that occasion the movement of goods from one state to another. Citing Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S.R. Sarkar, the court determined that if the movement of goods is a result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale, it qualifies as an inter-state sale. The court found that the contract stipulation requiring weighment at Gondia (outside Madhya Pradesh) necessitated the movement of goods, making it an inter-state sale.","The appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was set aside, holding that the sales of manganese ore by the appellant were in the course of inter-State trade and therefore exempted from tax."

The Sales Tax Officer considered it a sale of goods, while the respondent argued it was a works contract. The core dispute revolves around whether the contract was primarily for the sale of goods or for rendering a service.","The court determined whether the contract was for sale of goods or service based on the main object of the parties, the terms of the contract, transaction circumstances, and trade customs. The court cited several precedents, including The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd., to differentiate between sale and works contracts. The court emphasized that the primary undertaking was to 'fix' the windows, requiring special technical skill, and property only passed upon completion of the fixing.","The court held that the contract was for rendering service, not for the sale of goods, and therefore the amount received by the respondent was not taxable."

JUDGMENT
J.C. Shah, J.
1. The appellants are a firm having their head office at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh and branch
offices at Lucknow, Kanpur, Faizabad and Bombay. They are engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling bidis, and are registered as dealers under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax
Act, 1947. Between November, 1948, and October 12, 1949, the appellants despatched bidis of the
value of Rs. 22,60,241-5-0 to their branch offices outside the State of Madhya Pradesh, and bidis of
the value of Rs. 5,35,404-15-0 under instructions from their branches to other destinations outside
the State. The Sales Tax Officer rejected the contention of the appellants that the turnover resulting
from the sale of bidis supplied to the branches and under instructions from the branches was not
liable to be taxed under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and brought the aggregate turnover
of Rs. 27,85,646-4-0 to tax. In appeal, the Deputy Commissioner reduced the taxable turnover by 5
per cent. The order of the Deputy Commissioner was confirmed in appeal to the Commissioner of
Sales Tax. A revision application filed before the Sales Tax Tribunal was unsuccessful.
2. At the instance of the appellants, the Tribunal submitted a statement","Anwar Khan Mehboob Company, a bidi manufacturer, was assessed sales tax under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, on sales to its branch offices outside Madhya Pradesh and sales made under instructions from its branches to destinations outside the state. The company contested the tax assessment, arguing that these transactions were not liable to tax under the Act. The dispute centered on whether these transactions constituted 'sales' within the meaning of the Act and whether they occurred within the state.","The court analyzed Section 2(g) of the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, specifically Explanation II, which deems a sale to have taken place within the province if the goods were actually within the Central Provinces and Berar at the time the contract of sale was made, regardless of where the contract was made. The court referenced Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, affirming the provincial legislature's competence to levy sales tax based on the theory of territorial nexus. The court clarified that the existence of goods within the province at the date of the contract is a condition for tax liability.",The court answered the questions by stating that the turnover is liable to sales tax only insofar as it arises out of sales made in pursuance of contracts relating to goods which were in existence within the Province at the date of the contract; the Tribunal will decide the case accordingly.

Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar*. The court interpreted that a 'sale' requires a contract with mutual assent and that the U.P. Wheat Procurement (Levy) Order imposed a compulsory obligation, not a consensual agreement, therefore not constituting a sale.","The appeals were allowed, with the court holding that the supply of wheat under the U.P. Wheat Procurement (Levy) Order, 1959, did not constitute a sale and was therefore not subject to sales tax."

The appellants challenged the process by which the Regional Transport Authority fixed the limit of permits and whether hearings were required. The core dispute revolves around the procedure for granting permits and the rights of operators in the context of regional, inter-regional, and inter-state permits.","The court analyzed Section 47(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, determining that a Regional Transport Authority is not required to hold hearings when limiting the number of stage carriage permits. The court distinguished between the authority's function in limiting permits under Section 47(3) and granting permits under Section 48. Precedents such as Abdul Mateen v. Ram Kailash Pandey were cited to support the view that the limit of permits should be fixed before granting permits to ensure fair competition.","The court found that in the specific facts and circumstances of the appeals, there was a valid order under Section 47(3) of the Act and a notification under Section 57(2) of the Act, although the scheme of the statute had not been followed in all the appeals."

claims and counter claims and the umpire after","Allen Berry & Co. (P) Ltd. and the Union of India were in dispute over the sale of United States surplus war materials, specifically vehicles and other stores. The appellant-company alleged misconstruction of the sale contracts and failure to consider relevant documents by the umpire in arbitration proceedings. The main grievance revolved around the contents and quantity of vehicles delivered under the contracts.","The court analyzed Section 30 of the Arbitration Act 1940, focusing on the grounds for setting aside an award, particularly errors apparent on the face of the award. Precedents like Union of India v. Bungo Steel Furniture Pvt. Ltd. and Champsey Bhara & Co. v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd. were cited to establish that courts should not readily interfere with arbitration awards unless there is corruption, fraud, or a legal error apparent on the face of the award or incorporated documents. The court determined that a mere general reference to a contract does not incorporate it into the award.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the judgment of the High Court which refused to set aside the umpire's award. The appellant company's claims were rejected, and the company remained liable to pay the Government as per the umpire's decision."

The dispute centered on whether the contract between Hindustan Aeronautics and the Railway Board was a sale of goods or a works contract, specifically concerning railway coaches models 407, 408, and 411.","The court analyzed the terms of the contract and surrounding circumstances to determine if it was a works contract or a contract of sale, citing the State of Gujarat v. Kailash Engineering Co. precedent. The key factor was that the materials used in the construction of the coaches belonged to the Railways, indicating a works contract where the assessee provided services rather than selling goods. Material and wage escalator and adjustments regarding final price mentioned in the contract are neutral factors.","The High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order including the turnover relating to the construction of railway coaches, models 407, 408 and 411, effectively ruling that the transaction was a works contract and not subject to sales tax."

HEADNOTE:
By Mysore Act 11 of 1961 which came into force on October 1,
1961 sugarcane was included at Serial No. 11-A in the  Third
Schedu","Salar Jung Sugar Nulls Ltd. and other sugar factories appealed against the State of Mysore's levy of purchase tax on sugarcane purchased from growers. The appellants argued that Central and State Control Orders negated mutual assent in the transactions, they were not 'dealers' under the Mysore Sales Tax Act, and the tax rates across states were discriminatory. The core issue was whether the regulated supply of sugarcane constituted a 'sale' under the Mysore Sales Tax Act.","The court analyzed whether the Control Orders eliminated the element of mutual assent necessary for a sale. It cited precedents like Indian Steel & Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras and Andhra Sugars Ltd. & Anr. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, establishing that regulatory orders don't entirely negate contractual freedom. The court found that despite restrictions on area, parties, and price, elements of choice remained, such as delivery terms and quantity, indicating mutual agreement.","The appeals were dismissed, with the court holding that the transactions amounted to sales under the Mysore Sales Tax Act and that the factories were indeed 'dealers'. The court also found no violation of Article 14 regarding discriminatory tax rates."

JUDGMENT
J.C. Shah, C.J.
1. Section 5(2)(a)(v) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, provides :
(2) In this Act the expression 'taxable turnover' means in the case of a dealer who is
liable to pay tax under Section 4 or under Sub-section (3) of Section 8, that part of his
gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting there from
(a) his turnover during that period on....
(v) sales of goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner not to
have taken place in West Bengal, or to have taken place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce, within the meaning of Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act,
1956, or in the course of import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the
territory of India, within the meaning of Section 5 of that Act.
2. The respondent-company carries on the business of a colliery. Pursuant to an agreement between
the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan, the former agreed to release certain
quantities of coal for consumption in East Pakistan. The respondent-company delivered coal to the
Fuel Inspector, Eastern Bengal Railway, East Pakistan, of the total value of Rs. 88,929-10-0. In
respect of this supply of coal, bills were drawn by the respondent in the name of the Deputy Coal
Commissioner","The State of West Bengal appealed against North Adjai Coal Co. Ltd. regarding sales tax levied on coal supplied to the Fuel Inspector, Eastern Bengal Railway, East Pakistan, under an agreement between the Governments of India and Pakistan. The company claimed exemption from sales tax under Section 5(2)(a)(v) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, arguing the sale was in the course of export, a claim initially rejected by tax authorities but later upheld by the High Court.","The court considered Section 5(2)(a)(v) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, which provides an exemption for sales of goods that took place in the course of export. The court found it unnecessary to determine whether the sale was to the Government of India or Pakistan, as it concluded that the sale, if any, was exempt from sales tax because it occurred during export. The court also addressed the State's argument that the High Court should not have entertained the writ petition due to the availability of statutory remedies, stating that while exhausting statutory remedies is a normal practice, it is not a jurisdictional bar and the High Court acted appropriately.","The appeal by the State of West Bengal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that North Adjai Coal Co. Ltd. was exempt from sales tax on the coal supplied to Pakistan."

The plaintiffs sued for specific performance or, alternatively, a refund from G. The trial court decreed specific performance, but G died during the appeal process, and his legal representatives were not impleaded in time, leading to the question of whether the appeal abates as a whole.","The court considered Order 41 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the abatement of appeals. It held that the vendor (G) is a necessary party in a specific performance suit, especially when a refund is sought. Citing precedents like Gourishankar & Others v. Ibrahim Ali and Lala Durga Prasad & Another v. Lala Deep Chand & Others, the court reasoned that the vendor's involvement is crucial for executing the conveyance and incorporating any special covenants.","The appeal was dismissed due to the abatement concerning G, the vendor, proving fatal to the entire appeal, as inconsistent decrees would result or proper relief could not be granted in the absence of a necessary party."

Mundhra had an option to purchase shares, exercised it, but the shares were not transferred, leading to a decree for specific performance. The core issue was whether Hungerford Investment Trust could rescind the agreement and decree due to Mundhra's alleged failure to pay the consideration amount within a reasonable time.","The court considered the applicability of the Specific Relief Act of 1877 and 1963, along with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.

The court also analyzed Section 46 of the Contract Act regarding reasonable time for performance when no specific time is fixed in the contract.","The appeal was allowed, implying that the court found Hungerford Investment Trust was justified in rescinding the contract and decree.

The Income Tax Officer considered this amount as part of the auctioneer's income. The dispute centers on whether the sales tax collected by the auctioneer should be considered part of their business income and whether including ""auctioneer"" in the definition of ""dealer"" under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 is ultra vires.","The court analyzed Entry 48 of List II of Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, 1935 (taxes on the sale of goods) and its relation to the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. It referenced the Gannon Dunkerley's Case to establish that ""sale of goods"" should have the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The court held that an auction sale is a sale under the Sale of Goods Act and that the state legislature has the power to impose tax on an auctioneer who carries on the business of selling goods. The definition of ""dealer"" in Explanation 2 of S. 2(c) of the Bengal Act was not deemed ultra vires.","The appeal was dismissed, and the court held that the amount of sales tax received by the appellant as an auctioneer should be considered part of its trading or business receipts."

The State sought to split the transaction into service and sale of foodstuffs to levy sales tax on the latter.","The court distinguished between a contract of sale and a contract of work and service, emphasizing the need to determine the primary object of the transaction and the intention of the parties.

Devender Singh had agreed to sell his house to Khaja but later sold it to other defendants for a higher price. The main grievance was the breach of contract by Devender Singh.,"The court analyzed Section 12 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, focusing on the presumption that breach of contract to transfer immovable property cannot be adequately relieved by compensation in money. The court held that merely stipulating liquidated damages does not automatically rebut this presumption or bar specific performance under Section 21.

No specific product or service is involved; the case concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions related to public service appointments.,"The court analyzed Articles 316, 317, and 319 of the Constitution of India, determining that the office of member is distinct from that of Chairman. The court interpreted Article 316(2) to mean that the term of six years begins when the individual starts functioning as Chairman. The court overruled the majority view in Dhivendra Krishna v. Corpn of Calcutta and approved Upenda Pas v. State.","The appeal was dismissed, and the respondent, R.V.

The agreements were executed in Delhi, with installments paid there, but the vehicles were located in Gujarat when the option to purchase was exercised. The dispute centered on whether Gujarat could tax the sale when the agreement was made outside the state but the goods were within the state at the time of the sale.","The court analyzed Section 2(28) of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, which defines 'sale' and incorporates principles from Section 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, regarding the location of a sale. The court held that the sale occurred in Gujarat because the goods were located there when the hirer exercised the option to purchase, thus completing the sale. The court also stated that there is no bar to a state taxing goods even if they have been taxed earlier by another state.","The petitions were dismissed, and the court held that the State of Gujarat was entitled to levy tax on the transaction of sale because the sale took place when the goods were inside the State of Gujarat."

assessee and the nature of the transactions  relating to the
supply of bus bodies has been found on the basis of  ""repair

the  judgm","M/S. T. V. Sundram Iyengar & Sons was assessed sales tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 and the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957 for constructing bus bodies and fitting them to chassis provided by customers. The dispute centers on whether this constitutes a 'sale of goods' or a 'works contract,' impacting sales tax liability. The main grievance is the imposition of sales tax on what the assessee argues is a contract for work and labour, not a sale.","The court considered whether the transactions constituted a 'sale of goods' under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 and the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957, interpreting the term as it is defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The court relied on the precedent set in The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. to determine that a sale of goods requires an agreement to sell movables for a price and the transfer of property. The court found that the property in the materials used to construct the bus bodies only passed to the customer upon delivery of the completed bus, indicating a sale of goods rather than a works contract.","The appeals were related to the assessment of sales tax; the document does not provide a clear final outcome (allowed/dismissed) for all appeals, but it discusses the factors considered in determining whether the transactions constituted a sale of goods."

The firm purchased raw jute in Orissa and dispatched it to buyers in Calcutta, with the sale concluding upon acceptance of the goods in Calcutta.","The court analyzed Section 2(g) and 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, along with Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, to determine the scope of 'sale' and whether the movement of goods was occasioned by the sale.

Precedents like Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bihar were relied upon.","The appeals were dismissed, affirming the High Court's judgment that the sales were interstate sales governed by Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act."

MOIL had contracts with buyers in India and abroad, categorized into direct exports (Category I), sales to MMTC for export (Category II), sales to buyers who then sold to MMTC for export (Category III), and domestic sales (Category IV). The dispute centered on whether sales in Categories II and III were exempt from tax as sales occasioning export.","The court applied Section 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, concerning sales occasioning export. Citing Md. Serajuddin & others v. State of Orissa, the court held that sales involving intermediaries between the seller and ultimate foreign buyers do not 'occasion export' and are not exempt under Section 5(1). The court also discussed the doctrine of 'Stare Decisis' and conditions for a sale to be considered in the course of inter-state trade or commerce under Section 3(a) and 9 of the Act.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the levy of sales tax on Categories II, III, and IV.

be  sold to and purchased by the Government of  India.   The
exact clause reads as under :
              ""Al","Oil India Ltd. filed a petition against the Superintendent of Taxes & Others, disputing the levy of Central Sales Tax on the supply of crude oil to the Barauni Refinery in Bihar. Oil India argued that the sales were intrastate and taxable under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, while the Assam Sales Tax Authorities claimed it was an interstate sale subject to Central Sales Tax. The core issue revolves around whether the movement of crude oil from Assam to Bihar constitutes an interstate sale.","The court applied Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, which defines when a sale is deemed to occur in the course of interstate trade or commerce, specifically if the sale occasions the movement of goods from one state to another. Citing precedents like Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar and The State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors. v. Caltex (India) Ltd., the court emphasized that if the movement of goods is a result of a covenant or an incident of the contract of sale, it constitutes an interstate sale. The court interpreted the agreement between the parties as contemplating the movement of crude oil from Assam to Bihar as an integral part of the sale.","The court held that the sales were in the course of interstate trade, and the Bihar Government lacked jurisdiction to tax the sales under the Bihar Sales Tax Act. The Bihar Sales Tax Authorities were directed not to impose sales tax and to refund the sales tax already collected."

JUDGMENT
R.S. Sarkaria, J.
1. The common question of law that arises in these appeals by the same assessee is : Whether the
sales in question made by the asses-see were sales effected in the course of export of goods out of the
territory of India and as such were exempt from imposition of sales tax under Article 286(1)(b) of
the Constitution ?
2. The relevant assessment years are 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60. The assessee, the New
Rajasthan Mineral Syndicate, is registered as a dealer under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948.
It is not registered under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for short, called the Act). The assessee
carries on the business of quarry contractOrs. In the relevant years, it held a licence from the then
Punjab State to quarry iron-ore at Nizampur, District Mohindergarh.
3. During the assessment years in question, the Sales Tax Officer assessed the assessee-firm to tax
under Section 9 of the Act on a turnover of Rs. 3,18,757.6, Rs. 3,99,948.93 and Rs. 5 lakhs,
respectively. The last assessment was made on the best judgment basis.
4. To impugn these assessment orders, the assessee filed three writ petitions ","The State of Punjab (now Haryana) appealed against the New Rajasthan Mineral Syndicate regarding sales tax assessments for the years 1957-58, 1958-59, and 1959-60. The dispute centers on whether the assessee's sales of iron-ore to Sri Narayan & Co. (acting on behalf of the State Trading Corporation for export to Japan) qualify for exemption from sales tax under Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution, which exempts sales made in the course of export.","The court analyzed whether the sales by the assessee occasioned the export of goods out of India, as per Section 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, enacted pursuant to Article 286(2) of the Constitution. The court considered arguments regarding privity of contract between the assessee and the foreign buyer, and whether the sales were 'for export' or 'in the course of export'. Precedents like Coffee Board, Bangalore v. Joint Commercial Tax Officer, Madras and others were referenced.",Not available in document

The respondents, various dealers, were assessed or faced pre-assessment proceedings for purchase turnover of goods like arecanuts, gingelly seeds, butter, turmeric, grams, and castor seeds, arguing that Section 7-A was unclear and inapplicable to their transactions.","The Supreme Court interpreted Section 7-A as both a charging and remedial provision aimed at preventing tax evasion. The court emphasized that the provision's workability should be preserved, and a construction that defeats its purpose should be avoided. The court clarified that the ingredients of Section 7-A(1) must be cumulatively satisfied, and that the goods must be 'taxable goods' even if the specific purchase did not attract tax under sections 3, 4, or 5. The court applied the precedent of Ganesh Prasad Dixit v. Commissioner of Sales-tax.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the High Court's judgment and upholding the validity of the assessments under Section 7-A of the Tamil Nadu General Sales-tax Act, 1959."

Indian","The case involves appeals concerning whether certain corporations, specifically the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Life Insurance Corporation, and Industrial Finance Corporation, are considered 'state' entities under Article 12 of the Constitution. The dispute revolves around the legal status and authority of these corporations, particularly regarding their ability to frame rules and regulations affecting employees and third parties. The main grievance appears to be related to the termination of services and the enforceability of regulations made by these corporations.","The court analyzed the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1956, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and the Industrial Finance Corporation Act, 1948, focusing on sections related to the powers and functions of these corporations. Precedents like Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohan Lal were cited to determine if these corporations could be considered 'state' entities based on their statutory powers and control by the government. The court considered whether the corporations had the power to issue binding directions and whether disobedience of those directions would entail penal consequences.","The court held that the rules and regulations framed by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission have the force of law. The appeals were disposed of accordingly, with specific outcomes for each civil appeal, including setting aside judgments and granting or denying writs of mandamus, with parties bearing their own costs."

JUDGMENT
A.N. Ray, C.J. 
1. This appeal by certificate is on the question whether there was any contract of sale pursuant to
which goods were moved from the State of Tamil Nadu to the Stale of West Bengal.
2. The respondent Cement Distributors Private Limited are the agents of the State Trading
Corporation. Under the Cement Control Order all manufacturers are required to sell cement to State
Trading Corporation. On 22 November, 1961 the Regional Cement Officer of the State Trading
Corporation in Tamil Nadu authorised to respondent to sell the quantity of cement mentioned in the
authorisation note of that date to persons directed by the Regional Cement Officer, State Trading,
Corporation Calcutta. The authorisation was in favour of the respondent. The factory which was to
supply cement was also mentioned in the note as Dalmiapuram factory. The authorisation further
said that 9,000 metric (sic)ons were alloted for the fourth period in 1961 for distribution to Calcutta
area as directed by the Regional Cement Officer, State Trading Corporation, Calcutta.
3. On 4 November, 1961, there was another authorisation issued by the Regional Cement Officer at
Calcutta. The note mentioned the respondent Cement Distributors as suppliers. The note said that
","The State of Tamil Nadu appealed against the Cement Distributors (P) Ltd. regarding the assessment of Central Sales Tax on transactions involving the movement of cement from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal. The dispute centered on whether the movement of cement was a result of a prior contract of sale, making it an inter-state sale liable for tax. The State argued that the cement was shipped for direct sale to a purchaser in Calcutta.","The court analyzed Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, which defines inter-state sales as those where the movement of goods from one state to another is a result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale. Citing Tata Iron & Steel Co, Ltd. v. S R. Sarkar, the court determined that the cement was dispatched by the respondent to themselves in Calcutta based on the State Trading Corporation's directions, not as a result of a prior contract with a buyer. Therefore, the transactions did not qualify as inter-state sales under the Act.","The appeal by the State of Tamil Nadu was dismissed, with the court ruling that the transactions were not inter-state sales liable to tax under the Central Sales Tax Act."

        to  an intermediary, shall continue to belong to or be  ","Maharaj Singh, the former zamindar, was sued by the State of Uttar Pradesh and the Gaon Sabha for ejectment from an estate where he conducted a cattle fair. The dispute arose after the zamindari system was abolished and the land was vested in the Gaon Sabha, with the State retaining certain powers. The main grievance was the defendant's continued use of the land and structures despite the vesting order.","The court analyzed Section 117 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, 1950, interpreting the vesting of land in the Gaon Sabha as a qualified disposition subject to the State's power of resumption. It also considered the meaning of 'appurtenance' under Section 9 of the Act, limiting it to land strictly necessary for the use of buildings. The court cited Dhabolkar [1976] 1 S.C.R. 306 regarding the broadened scope of 'locus standi'.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the State had the right to appeal and that the defendant was only entitled to the structures and a small area around them, not the entire estate."

The appellants sold manganese ore to the Mines and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC), which then exported the ore. The dispute centered on whether the appellants were the 'last purchasers' within Andhra Pradesh and thus liable for sales tax, or whether MMTC was the last purchaser.","The court analyzed whether the contracts between the merchants and MMTC were integrated contracts in the course of export or separate contracts. Citing precedents like Mohd. Serajuddin v. State of Orissa, Coffee Board v. Joint Commercial Tax Officer, and Binani Bros. v. Union of India, the court emphasized that a sale qualifies as being in the course of export only if it directly causes the export. The court clarified that the mere mention of F.O.B. terms in the contract between the merchant and MMTC does not make it an export sale if MMTC has a separate export contract.","The appeals were allowed, holding that the MMTC, not the appellants, was the last purchaser liable for sales tax within the State of Andhra Pradesh."

The dispute centered around the interpretation of the Transfer of Property Act concerning the right of redemption after a mortgagee exercises the power of sale without court intervention. The product involved is the mortgaged land and incomplete structure.","The court analyzed Section 69 of the Transfer of Property Act regarding the mortgagee's power of sale and the mortgagor's right of redemption. It distinguished between English and Indian law, emphasizing that in India, the right of redemption is extinguished only upon execution and registration of the transfer, not merely by a contract for sale. The court also considered Section 202 of the Indian Contract Act regarding agency coupled with interest, but found it did not negate the mortgagor's right to redeem before the sale was complete.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the mortgagor's right to redeem the property even after the auction sale, as the conveyance was not complete."

ONGC argued that the supplies were made under the directions of the Central Government, lacking a contract of sale and volition on their part. They also contended that if considered sales, they were interstate sales, making Bihar incompetent to levy sales tax.","The court relied on the precedent set in Salar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Mysore, stating that statutory orders regulating supply and distribution under Control Orders do not negate the freedom to contract. The court reasoned that even with government directives on supply, price, and timing, the transactions still constitute a valid transfer of property for consideration, with the statute providing the consensus. The court found that the transactions satisfied all ingredients of a sale.","The court held that the supplies of crude oil constituted interstate sales, making only the State of Assam entitled to levy central sales tax on the Commission."

The core dispute revolves around whether the 'lease deed' constitutes a sale of goods, specifically bamboo and salai wood, making the timber extraction liable to sales tax under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958. The respondent repudiated the appellant's claim to pay sales-tax on the timber extracted under the 'lease deed'.","The court analyzed the definition of 'sale of goods' under s.2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 2(g) of the Sales Tax Act, determining that standing timber is 'movable property' if it is to be severed under the contract. The court distinguished the case from precedents like Raja Bahadur Kamakshya Narain Singh (1943) and Badri Prasad [1969], emphasizing that in this case, the bamboo and salai wood were intended to be cut and severed pursuant to the contract itself. The court found that the deed conferred a right to cut and carry timber, with property passing upon severance, and royalty being a euphemism for the price of the timber.","The appeal was allowed, and the case was remanded for consideration of the quantum of tax that the Forest Department was legally liable to pay as a dealer to the Sales Tax Department, with the respondent's payment to follow once the tax is settled."

Ltd. regarding sales tax assessments under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The dispute centered on whether the 'Oriental Mixture' of manganese ore, created by mixing different grades during unloading, constituted a new product taxable at the time of contract. The assessee contended that the mixture came into existence only after the ores were mixed, and therefore, was not taxable as goods existing in the state when the contracts were made.","The court analyzed Section 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, specifically Explanation II, which deemed sales of goods within the state at the time of contract as taxable. The court also considered the validity of an amending act that sought to substitute this explanation but failed to receive the necessary assent. The court interpreted 'substitution' to mean that if the substituted provision is ineffective, the pre-existing provision continues to apply. Several precedents were cited, including Koteswar Vittal Kamath v.K. Rangappa Balica & Co. and Firm .A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co. v.

     The respondents  are dealers under the Tamil Nadu Sales
Tax Act.  Section 14  of the  Central Sales Tax Act declares
certain goods enumerated therein of `' special importance in
inter-state trade  or commerce.  The list  of goods given at
serial No. IV reads as ","The State of Tamil Nadu appealed against a Madras High Court decision regarding the taxation of iron and steel goods. The respondents, dealers under the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Act, converted iron scrap into steel products and argued that these products should not be taxed again if the scrap had already been taxed, claiming both fell under the broad category of ""Iron and Steel."" The dispute centered on whether different forms of iron and steel should be treated as separate taxable commodities.","The court analyzed Section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act, which lists goods of special importance in inter-state trade, and Section 15, which prohibits taxation at more than one stage. The court interpreted the phrase 'that is to say' in Section 14 to indicate distinct taxable commodities within the broader category of 'Iron and Steel,' rather than a single commodity. The court distinguished State of Madhya Pradesh v. Hira Lal and applied the case of Devidas, emphasizing that sales tax law taxes sales of goods, not the substance they are made of.","The appeal was allowed, with the court holding that each sub-item in clause IV of Section 14 should be considered a separate taxable commodity for sales tax purposes."

1. This is an appeal under Section 55 of the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Act. 1969
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), against the order and judgment of the Monopolies & Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the ""Commission'), in
proceedings started under Section 10(a)(iv) of the Act against the appellant M/s. Hindustan Lever
Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'the Company'), upon information furnished by Bhogilal Manilal
Shah of M/s. Shah Manilal Motichand & Sons of Poona (hereinafter referred to as the 'informant').
2. The informant was a redistribution stockist of the appellant company carrying on business
regulated by the terms of an agreement, known as the redistribution stockists' agreement of the
company, found in a standard printed form entered into with each stockist. The agreement has 23
terms or clauses in it. The clauses complained of are 6 and 9, which may be reproduced here:
5. The Redistribution Stockist shall use his best endeavours to maintain and increase
the trade of the products in the said town and for this purpose, he shall at all times
keep ","Hindustan Lever Ltd. appealed against the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Commission's order concerning restrictive trade practices. The dispute arose from clauses in Hindustan Lever's agreement with its redistribution stockists, specifically clauses 5 and 9, which the informant, a former stockist, alleged were unreasonable and illegal. The case involves the sale and distribution of Hindustan Lever's products through its stockists.","The court analyzed the case under the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, specifically Sections 2(o) and 2(u) defining 'restrictive trade practice' and 'trade practice'. The court interpreted that a trade practice includes not only actual restrictions but also practices that 'may have' the effect of restricting competition. The court distinguished this case from the Telco case, emphasizing that each business has unique characteristics and the impact on competition must be assessed in context.","The document does not contain the final outcome of the appeal. It only details the background, arguments, and legal reasoning up to a certain point."

","Juggilal Kamlapat, the appellant-plaintiff, sued Pratapmal Rameshwar, the respondent, for breach of contract related to the sale of B. Twill and Hessian goods. The respondent refused to accept ""Pucca Delivery Orders"" tendered by the appellant, arguing they were not valid delivery orders as per the contract, which stipulated payment in exchange for delivery orders on sellers. The core dispute revolves around whether these pucca delivery orders, with their conditions and restrictions, constituted valid delivery orders under the Sale of Goods Act and the terms of the contract.","The court analyzed Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, regarding the definition of a ""document of title to goods,"" and Sections 18 and 23 concerning the transfer of property in unascertained goods. The court held that the pucca delivery orders were not documents of title because they contained stipulations allowing mills to refuse delivery unless additional conditions were met, effectively requiring a new contract. The court also considered Section 92 of the Evidence Act, barring oral evidence to contradict a written contract, and found that custom could not override express statutory provisions or contract terms. Several precedents were cited, including Anglo-India Jute Mills Co. v. Omademull and Jute & Gunny Brokers Ltd. v.

P.S. Kailasam, J.
1. In both the appeals the plaintiff is the appellant by virtue of the certificate issued by the High
Court of Delhi, Himachal Pradesh Bench, Simla. The question that arises in both the appeals is the
same and the learned Counsel are agreed that the disposal of Civil Appeal No. 1678 of 1968 would
dispose of Civil Appeal No. 2124 of 1968. We will therefore take up the facts in Civil Appeal No. 1678
of 1968 only.
2. The plaintiff, Karnal Distillary Co. Ltd. filed this suit for recovery of a sum of Rs. 25,270/-,
principal being Rs. 22264/6/3 and interest at the rate of 6% per annum amounting to Rs.
3,005/9/9. The case for the plaintiff appellant is that on 20th July, 1950 the plaintiff and Himachal
Pradesh Government entered into an agreement under Ex. P-1 dated 20-7-1950 by which the
plaintiff agreed to supply 12,000 L. P. gallons, with 10% variation of quantity on either side, of

commencing from August 1, 1950 at the rates mentioned in the agreement, The plaintiff offered to
supply 10 800 L. P. gallons of liquor during the said period. The Himachal Pradesh Government
accepted 10580.3 L.P. gallons. While the Government disposed of 7934.5 L.P. gallons, the remai","Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. sued the Union of India (Himachal Pradesh Government) for recovery of money due for supplying country liquor. The distillery claimed the government failed to pay the contractual price for a portion of the liquor supplied under an agreement. The government argued it was acting under the Punjab Excise Act and was only liable for the price fixed by the Collector, not the contractual rate.","The court analyzed the agreement (Ex. P-1) and determined it was a bilateral contract between the distillery and the government, not a regulatory action under the Excise Act. The court interpreted the contract clauses to mean the government was obligated to pay the contractual price for the liquor supplied. The court distinguished this case from precedents involving sovereign functions, emphasizing that this was a purely contractual matter.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the High Court's judgment, and confirmed the trial court's decree, holding that the government was bound to pay the contractual price for the liquor."

Swaika Oil Mills sold linseed oil to the Netherlands Selling Organisation under an F.O.B. Calcutta contract, and claimed the sale was in the course of export, thus exempt from sales tax. The Revenue Authorities rejected the claim, but the High Court allowed it.","The court applied Section 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and relied on the precedent Mohd. Serajuddin etc. v. State of Orissa. The court reasoned that there were two independent sales: one between Swaika Oil Mills and the Netherlands Selling Organisation, and another between the Netherlands Selling Organisation and a foreign buyer. The export was occasioned by the latter sale, not the former, and there was no privity of contract between Swaika Oil Mills and the foreign buyer.","The appeal was allowed, and the court held that the sale by Swaika Oil Mills was not in the course of export and was therefore subject to sales tax."

        allotted to ","Piarey Lal agreed to sell his land to Hori Lal but refused after consolidation under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953. Hori Lal sued for specific performance, arguing the agreement created a liability transferable to the new plot. The dispute centers on whether the agreement for sale created a liability that transferred to the new land allotted after consolidation.","The court analyzed Section 30 of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, in conjunction with Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act. It held that an agreement for sale does not create any interest ""in"" the property itself, and therefore no liability is transferred to the new land after consolidation. The court overruled Shanti Prasad v. Akhtar & Anr. and Chettan Singh & Ors. v. Hira Singh & Ors., approving Sagna & Anr. v. Kali Ram & Ors.","The appeal was allowed, and the suit for specific performance was dismissed; however, Piarey Lal was ordered to refund Rs. 3000 with 6% interest per annum to Hori Lal."

stipulated that i","R. Dalmia, the assessee, borrowed money to purchase shares from Bharat Bank Ltd. but did not take delivery of the shares immediately. The dispute revolves around the deductibility of interest paid on the loan and damages paid for failure to take delivery of the shares, as well as the inclusion of dividend income in the assessee's total income under the Income Tax Act, 1922.","The court analyzed Section 12(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, outlining conditions for expenditure deductibility, including being solely for earning income, not being capital or personal expenditure, and having a clear nexus to the income earned. The court cited precedents like Bank of India v. J. A. H. Chinoy regarding dividend accrual and Eastern Investments Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal regarding the nexus between expenditure and income. The court determined that the interest paid was a permissible deduction because of the direct nexus to the dividend income.","The appeal was allowed in part, with the court holding that the interest paid by the assessee was a permissible deduction, but the damages paid were capital expenditure and the dividend earned should be included in the total income."

1. Whether, on the facts of this case, the contract dated June 15, 1968, between the Union of India
and the Central India Machinery Manufacturing Company Ltd. (Wagon & Structural Division),
Bharatpur (hereinafter called the company), for the manufacture and supply of wagons, was a
contract of sale or a works contract, is the principal question that falls to be determined in this
appeal by certificate, filed by the Union of India against a judgment dated January 31, 1969, of the
High Court of Rajasthan. It arises out of these facts:
The company, respondent No. 1 herein, entered into a contract No.
67/RS(I)/954/l5/396 dated June 15, 1968, with the Union of India through the
Railway Board for the manufacture and supply of 258 BG Bogie covered BCX type
wagons and 812 MG covered wagons of MBC type to the railways. The sales tax
authorities of the State (respondent No. 3 herein) under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act,
levied the sales tax treating the contract as one of sale and delivery of wagons. Under
a similar past contract, the appellant reimbursed the company the amount of sales
tax for the wagons supplied by it to the appellant in the months of March and April,
1967. In March, 1967, the High Court of Mysore in the case of Hindustan Aeronautics

Ata Ilahi Khan then sold his right to repurchase to Brij Mohan and Chandrapal Singh (plaintiffs-respondents). The plaintiffs filed a suit for specific performance of the contract, which was initially dismissed but later decreed by the first appellate court and affirmed by the High Court.","The court considered Section 154 of the U.P.

The court found that the plaintiffs did not exceed this limit, thus Section 154 did not apply. The court also upheld the lower courts' finding that a prior sale deed of the right to repurchase was a sham transaction and did not transfer title.","The appeal by Jagdish Chander (Dead) By L.

forest  known  as Huchbodi Nendwadi coupe for a ","The case involves a dispute between Pushpapriyadevi (appellant), the State of Maharashtra (respondent), and the ex-proprietor of Ahiri Zamindar. The appellant entered into a forest contract with the ex-proprietor to cut trees before the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act came into force. The appellant's grievance is that the State government refused permission to remove the cut trees unless an additional payment was made, despite the appellant claiming to have already paid the ex-proprietor.","The court analyzed Sections 3 and 6 of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950. Section 6 states that any transfer of rights liable to vest in the State after March 16, 1950, is void from the date of vesting. The court determined that the forest contract was a transfer of a right in property, not merely a sale of goods, and since the trees were not felled and ascertained before the vesting date, the contract was void. The court followed the precedent set in Badri Prasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. [1967] 2 S.C.R. 380.","The appeal was dismissed. The court held that since the contract was void under the Act, and the appellant agreed to pay the additional amount to remove the trees, they were not entitled to a refund."

JUDGMENT
Bhagwati, J.
1. This appeal by special leave raises the vexed question whether a particular contract is a contract of
sale or a contract of work and labour. This has always been a difficult question, because most of the
cases which come before the courts are border line cases and the decisions given by courts are by no
means uniform. But so far as the present case is concerned, it does not present any serious difficulty
and is comparatively free from complexity or doubt for there is a decision of this Court which is
directly applicable and is determinative of the controversy between the parties.
2. The assessee who is the appellant before us is a private limited company carrying on business as
engineers, contractors, manufacturers and fabricators and in the course of its business, it entered
into a contract dated 28th June, 1972 with M/s. C.M. Shah & Co. (P) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as
the Company) for fabrication, supply, erection and installation of Sentinel's Pull and Push type and
reduction Gear type rolling Shutters in sheds Nos. 3 and 4 of the Sidheswar Sahakari Sakar
Karkhana belonging to the Company. The detailed specifications of the Rolling Shutters were given
in the contract and the price was stipulated to be Rs. 7/- per sq","Sentinel Rolling Shutters, a private limited company, appealed against the Commissioner of Sales Tax's decision that their contract with M/s. C.M. Shah & Co. for fabrication, supply, erection, and installation of rolling shutters was a contract for sale, making them liable for sales tax. The dispute centered on whether the contract was a sale of goods or a contract for work and labor. The main grievance was the imposition of sales tax on the entire contract amount, with only a small percentage attributed to labor.","The judgment discusses the distinction between a contract for sale and a contract for work and labor, citing Halsbury's Laws of England and previous Supreme Court decisions like *Commissioner of Madhya Pradesh v. Purshottam Premji* and *State of Rajasthan v. Man Industrial Corporation*. The court emphasizes that the primary test is whether the main object of the contract is the transfer of property in a chattel as a chattel to the buyer, or the carrying out of work by bestowal of labor and service. The court analyzes the specifics of the contract to determine its true nature.",Not available in document

(P) Ltd. for fabrication, supply, erection, and installation of rolling shutters. A dispute arose regarding whether the contract was a contract for sale or a contract for work and labor, impacting the applicability of sales tax. The Commissioner of Sales Tax, Maharashtra, initially determined it was a sale, leading to the appeal.","The court analyzed the contract's terms, the circumstances of the transaction, and the custom of the trade to determine the main object of the parties. It distinguished between contracts for sale of goods and contracts for work and labor, citing Vanguard Rolling Shutters & Steel Works v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. The court emphasized that the erection and installation were integral to the contract, not merely incidental to a sale.","The appeal was allowed, with the court holding that the contract was a contract for work and labor, not a contract of sale."

in  the  reference made under s. 31A of the C.P.  and  Berar
Ind","Shivraj Fine Art Litho Works appealed against the State Industrial Court's award regarding wage disputes in the Litho Industry in the Vidarbha region. The dispute centered on the fixation of fair wages, fitment of employees into revised scales, and dearness allowance with retrospective effect. The core issue was whether the Industrial Court correctly classified employers based on their paying capacity and determined wage scales accordingly.","The court analyzed the powers of the Industrial Tribunal to fix industrial minimum wages, considering the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. It cited precedents like Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India to support the division of industries into classes based on paying capacity. The court clarified the distinction between minimum wage and fair wage, stating that minimum wage is fixed without regard to paying capacity, while fair wage considers the industry's financial health and other factors.","The appeals were allowed in part, and the order of remand was modified. The court held that the tribunal was called upon to fix a fair wage and not a minimum wage, and the financial capacity of the concerns classified under B is relevant."

The petitioner contended that the office of Governor constitutes such employment, thus invalidating the appointment. The case revolves around the interpretation of 'employment under the Government of India' in the context of the Governor's office.","The court analyzed Article 319(d) of the Constitution, focusing on whether the office of Governor constitutes 'employment under the Government of India.'

Precedents such as Pradyat Kumar Bose v. The Hon'ble the Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court were referred to. The court interpreted 'employment' in Article 319(d) to require a relationship of employer and employee, or control by the government, neither of which applies to the Governor's position.","The court held that the office of Governor of a State is not an employment under the Government of India and therefore does not fall within the prohibition of Article 319(d) of the Constitution, thus the petition was dismissed."

The State sought to recover the difference between Minocha's initial bid and the resale price. Minocha contested the suit, arguing the absence of a completed contract and non-compliance with constitutional requirements.","The court considered Article 299 of the Constitution of India and Section 39 of the U.P. Excise Act, 1910, along with Rule 357 of the Excise Manual. The majority opinion held that there was no concluded contract because the bid was not sanctioned by the Excise Commissioner, and the rule allowing recovery of deficiency on resale was not properly published. The dissenting opinion argued that Minocha's liability arose from his actions and the conditions of the auction, even without a formal contract.","The Supreme Court dismissed the State's suit, finding that there was no concluded contract and no statutory rule permitting recovery of the deficiency on resale from the respondent."

JUDGMENT
V.R. Krishna Iyer, J.
1. The last judicial lap of the journey to gender justice made by Fazlunbi, a married woman just past
30 years and talaged into destitution, constitutes the compassionate core of this case. The saga of
Fazlunbi, who had earlier secured an order for maintenance in her favour Under Section 125 Cr. P.C.
which was cancelled Under Section 127(3)(b) Cr. P.C., by three courts, tier upon tier in the vertical
system, by concurrent misinterpretation of the relevant provision, constitutes the kernel of her legal
grievance. If her plea has substance, social justice has been jettisoned by judicial process and a just
and lawful claim due to a woman in distress has been denied heartlessly and lawlessly. We say
'heartlessly', because no sensitive judge with empathy for the weaker sex could have callously
cancelled an order for a monthly allowance already made in her favour, as has been done here. We
say lawlessly', because no disciplined judge bound by the decision of this Court which lays down the
law for the nation under Article 141 of the Constitution could have defied the crystal clear ruling of
this Court in Bai Tahir","Fazlunbi, a divorced Muslim woman, appealed against the cancellation of her maintenance order under Section 125 Cr.P.C. The husband had divorced her and paid a small sum as mahar and iddat dues, leading lower courts to believe he was no longer obligated to pay maintenance. Fazlunbi argued that the mahar was insufficient for her maintenance and that the cancellation was unjust.","The court analyzed Section 127(3)(b) Cr.P.C., which allows cancellation of maintenance if a sum is paid under customary or personal law on divorce. The court relied heavily on the precedent set in Bai Tahira v.

The dispute arose over whether the sale of naphtha should be taxed under the Central Sales Tax Act (inter-state sale) or the U.P. Sales Tax Act (local sale), with both U.P. and Bihar authorities claiming the right to tax the sale.","The court relied on Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and precedents like Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar, stating that a sale is inter-state if the movement of goods from one state to another is a result of a covenant in the contract of sale or an incident of that contract. The court interpreted the agreement between IOC and IEL, particularly clauses 3 and 8, to conclude that the movement of naphtha from Barauni to Kanpur was an integral part of the sale.","The court allowed the petition, holding that the sales of naphtha were inter-state sales and that the State of U.P. had no jurisdiction to assess the petitioners to sales tax under the State Act. The sales tax payable can only be assessed and collected by authorities in Bihar."

The respondent failed to honor the agreement, leading the minors to file a suit for specific performance. The core dispute revolves around the enforceability of a contract entered into by a guardian on behalf of minors for the purchase of property.","The court analyzed Section 11 of the Contract Act and Section 8 of the Hindu Minority Act, along with Section 55(5)(b) of the Transfer of Property Act, and cited precedents including Krishnaswami v. Sundarappayya and Mir Sarwarjan v. Fakhruddin Mohd. Chowdhary. The court determined that a guardian can enter into a contract on behalf of a minor if it benefits the minor's estate, and that the Hindu Minority Act empowers guardians to act in the minor's best interest, without the contract binding the minor by personal covenant.","The appeal was allowed with costs, and the trial court's decree for specific performance was restored, meaning the respondent had to sell the house as originally agreed."

The mortgagee claimed part performance of an unregistered sale agreement, arguing that the mortgagor was debarred from enforcing rights against him. A subsequent purchaser and a decree holder who attached the property are also parties to the dispute.","The court analyzed Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, focusing on the doctrine of part performance. It emphasized the need for a written contract, acts unequivocally referable to the contract, and a real nexus between the contract and the acts of part performance. The court distinguished between entering into possession for the first time and continuing in possession, requiring independent evidence of part performance in the latter case. The court also considered Order 22 Rule 10 and Section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the decree holder's application.","The appeal was allowed, and the mortgagee was deemed not entitled to the benefit of the equitable doctrine of part performance.

The dispute centered on the assessee's claim for exemptions on 'service discount' and 'sales returns' under the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963. The Deputy Commissioner disallowed the 'service discount' and a portion of the 'sales returns'.","The court analyzed Rule 9(a) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963, regarding discounts, and Rule 9(b)(i) concerning returned goods. The court determined that the 'service discount' qualified as a trade discount under Rule 9(a) as it was an incentive to promote trade. However, the deduction for 'sales returns' could only be made from the turnover of the assessment year in which the goods were actually sold, not the year they were returned.","The appeal was partly allowed; the court dismissed the appeal regarding the 'service discount' but allowed it in respect of the 'sales returns', reversing the High Court's decision on that point."

JUDGMENT
1. The question which falls for determination in this appeal by special leave from the judgment and
order of the Kerala High Court is whether the amount claimed by the Appellant in a suit filed by him
against the Respondent was a ""debt"" within the meaning of that expression as denned in Clause (3)
of Section 2 of the Kerala Debt Relief Act, 1977, (hereinafter referred to as ""the said Act"") and was,
therefore, deemed to be discharged.
2. The Appellant's case as founded in the plaint was that the Respondent sold a cow and.a calf to
him for a sum of Rs. 1,600, and that the cow did not yield the quantity of milk which the Respondent
had stated it would yield and was suffering from an incurable disease which was concealed from the
Appellant by the Respondent. For this reason, the Appellant asked the Respondent to buy back the
said cow and the calf for the same price which had been paid by the Appellant to the Respondent
and thereupon the Respondent agreed to buy back the said cow and calf for a sum of Rs. 1,600. In
pursuance of this agreement, the said cow and calf were returned by the Appellant to the
Respondent. By his letter dated October 27, 1976, the Respondent acknowledged that he had
received back the said cow and calf and assured the App","Gopalakrishna Pillai sued K.M. Mani to recover Rs. 1,600, claiming Mani agreed to buy back a cow and calf that Pillai had purchased from him. Pillai alleged the cow didn't yield the promised milk and had a concealed disease. The core dispute was whether this amount was a 'debt' under the Kerala Debt Relief Act, 1977, and therefore discharged.","The court analyzed Section 2(3)(f) of the Kerala Debt Relief Act, 1977, which defines 'debt' but excludes debts representing the price of goods purchased. The court interpreted the transaction as a resale of goods from Pillai to Mani, making the money consideration the 'price of goods resold'. Therefore, the debt fell under the exception and was not discharged under the Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, disagreeing with the High Court's decision that the amount claimed did not represent the price of goods purchased."

The core dispute was whether the contracts between HAL and the IAF were contracts for sale of goods or contracts for work and labor, specifically regarding the spare parts supplied during the service contracts.","The court analyzed the distinction between a contract for sale of goods and a contract for work and labor, emphasizing that the dominant object of the contract determines its nature. Citing precedents like *State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.*, the court held that if the main object was the transfer of chattel as a chattel, it's a sale; otherwise, it's work and labor. The court also considered the specific terms of the contract, particularly clause 3, which stipulated that materials supplied by HAL would become the property of the owner (IAF) and treated as a 'contract loan'.","The appeal was allowed, with the court concluding that the High Court of Karnataka was incorrect in taxing the turnover of spare parts and materials supplied during HAL's job works because the property in the materials passed to the government before they were used."

1. This group of Writ Petitions and Appeals by Special Leave challenges the constitutional validity of
Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir General Sales Tax Act, 1962 (J

The assessees challenged the constitutionality of this section and the demand for interest payments.","The court examined the legislative competence of the State Legislature to enact laws providing for interest on delayed tax payments, referencing Article 265 of the Constitution and Section 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir General Sales Tax Act. It was determined that the power to make a law with respect to tax includes the power to provide for collection of tax, including prescribing methods for recovery and that payment of interest in case of default in payment of tax is a means of compelling an assessee to pay the tax due by the prescribed date. The court also considered Article 14 regarding discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable provisions.","The court upheld the constitutionality of sub-sections (1), (2), and (3) of Section 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir General Sales Tax Act 1962.

H. Anraj Etc vs Government Of Tamilnadu Etc on 4 October, 1985
Indian Kanoon - http://in","H. Anraj and other petitioners challenged the levy of sales tax on lottery tickets by the Governments of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The petitioners argued that lottery tickets are not 'goods' but actionable claims, and therefore, the state legislatures lacked the competence to impose sales tax on them. The core dispute revolves around whether the sale of a lottery ticket involves a transfer of property in goods.","The court analyzed Entry 54 of List II in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, concerning taxes on the sale or purchase of goods, along with relevant sections of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, and the Sale of Goods Act. The court interpreted 'goods' to include movable property, excluding actionable claims, and considered whether a lottery ticket constitutes 'goods' or an actionable claim. The court also considered Entry 62 of List II regarding taxes on betting and gambling.","The appeal was dismissed in part, and the writ petitions were allowed in part, holding that the amendments imposing a levy on sales of lottery tickets fall within the legislative competence of the State Legislature."

Sales","M/s Sahney Steel and Pressworks Ltd. challenged the Commercial Tax Officer's assessment of Central Sales Tax on non-standard goods transferred from their Hyderabad factory to branch offices outside Andhra Pradesh. The company argued these were stock transfers, while the tax officer considered them inter-state sales. The core dispute revolves around whether sales tax should be levied on these transactions.","The court applied Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, determining whether the movement of goods from Hyderabad was an incident of a contract of sale. Citing precedents like English Electric Company of India Ltd. v. The Deputy Commercial Tax officer & Ors., the court concluded that the movement was indeed occasioned by the order placed by the buyer, making it an inter-state sale. The court reasoned that the branch office acted as a conduit, and the registered office and branch office do not possess separate juridical personalities.","The petition was dismissed, affirming that the sale transactions were inter-state sales. However, the Commercial Tax Officer was directed to provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to collect 'C' Forms, and the petitioner Company may make an application to the assessing authority for deleting the turnover of sales found to be inter-State sales concerned for re-opening the assessments made under the State Sales Tax Acts."

The Rajasthan  Sales Tax  Act 1954  (State Act) by Sub-
section (o)  of s","Onkarlal Nandlal, a registered dealer in Rajasthan, purchased poppy seeds using declarations stating they were for resale within the state. However, the Commercial Tax Officer included the purchase price in the taxable turnover, arguing the resales were inter-state and thus not 'within the state'. The assessee appealed, contending the resales were still 'within the state' according to the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, despite being inter-state sales.","The court analyzed Explanation II to section 2(o) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, which incorporates section 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act. The court held that the rule of incorporation dictates that the incorporated provision (section 4(2)) should be read as if it were written directly into the Rajasthan Act. Therefore, the situs of the sale, determined by section 4(2), defines whether it's 'within the state,' irrespective of whether it's also an inter-state sale. The court cited In re Wood's Estate and Shamrao v. Parulekar, District Magistrate, Thana regarding the rule of incorporation.","The appeals were allowed, and the assessments including the purchase price in the taxable turnover were set aside, as the assessee resold the goods within the State as mentioned in the Declarations."

Indian Kanoon - http://indi","The State of Orissa appealed against a High Court decision that quashed notifications levying purchase tax on bamboos and standing trees agreed to be severed. The respondents, Tltaghur Paper Mills Company and others, had agreements with the state for felling and removing bamboos and trees. The dispute centered on whether these transactions constituted a sale of goods or a lease of immovable property, and whether the state's notifications were ultra vires the Orissa Sales Tax Act.","The court analyzed Section 3B and 5(1) of the Orissa Sales Tax Act 1947, along with Entry 54 List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, to determine the state's power to levy purchase tax. The court examined precedents related to the definition of 'sale of goods' and the distinction between movable and immovable property, referring to the Sale of Goods Act, Transfer of Property Act, and General Clauses Act. The court determined that the legislative competence to enact the Orissa Act was derived from section 100 (3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 read with Entry 48 in List II in the Seventh Schedule to that Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that the notifications levying purchase tax on bamboos and standing trees agreed to be severed were constitutional and valid."

JUDGMENT
A.P. Sen, J.
1. The short and narrow point involved in this appeal by special leave is whether upon the principles
laid down in United Commercial Bank v. Bank of India and Ors. the Court should not interfere in a
transaction between a banker and a beneficiary of a letter of guarantee or indemnity by grant of an
injunction at the instance of the buyer restraining the beneficiary from enforcing the liability under
the letter of indemnity executed by the banker which was absolute and upon a demand being made
by the beneficiary the bank became liable to honour the same, regardless of any controversy
between the parties i.e. the appellant who is the buyer, and respondent No. 1, the sellers, as to
whether the contract of sale had been performed.
2. Briefly stated, the facts are that the appellant, the buyer, covenanted to purchase and respondent
No. 1 Messrs Vinmar Impex Inc., Singapore, the sellers, agreed to sell and supply 100 M.T. of High
Density Polythene Powder called HOPE @ $565 per M.T. CIF, Calcutta on an irrevocable letter of
credit being opened by the appellant in favour of respondent ","Centax (India) Ltd. (buyer) contracted with Vinmar Impex Inc. (seller) for the purchase of High Density Polythene Powder. A dispute arose regarding the quality of the goods delivered and the failure to provide original shipping documents. The buyer sought an injunction to restrain Allahabad Bank from honoring letters of indemnity issued to the Shipping Company for releasing the goods without the original documents, and also to restrain the seller from recovering the amount due.","The court relied on the principles established in United Commercial Bank v. Bank of India, emphasizing that courts should not interfere in transactions between a banker and a beneficiary of a letter of guarantee or indemnity, especially when the bank's obligation is absolute upon demand. The court drew an analogy to irrevocable letters of credit, stating that commitments of banks must be honored to maintain trust in international commerce. The court found no prima facie case for the appellant and stated that the balance of convenience lay in allowing the banking transaction to proceed.","The appeal was dismissed with costs, upholding the High Court's decision to disallow the temporary injunction sought by the buyer."

HEADNOTE:
     The Writ  Petitioners and  appel","The case involves writ petitioners and appellants who were granted quarry and mining leases by the State of Gujarat for minor minerals. The dispute arose from notifications issued by the Gujarat government under Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, amending the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules, 1966, which enhanced royalty and dead rent rates. The main grievance was the validity of these notifications and Rule 21B of the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules, 1966, particularly concerning the power of the State Government to enhance rates during the subsistence of leases.","The court analyzed Section 15(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, determining its constitutionality and the extent of the rule-making power delegated to the State Government. It considered the legislative history and practice related to Entry 54 in the Union List and Entry 23 in the State List. The court interpreted the power to regulate under sections 13(1) and 15(1) as a power to control, govern, and direct the grant of licenses and leases, subject to restrictions and adaptations.","The court dismissed some appeals and writ petitions, allowed others in part, and allowed some completely, indicating a mixed outcome depending on the specific issues raised in each case. The specific relief granted (compensation, refund, etc.) is not detailed in this summary but varied based on the individual circumstances of each appeal and writ petition."

goods from foreign countries and after receipt of the goods,
kept  them  ","Madras Marine & Co., a ship chandler, imported goods from foreign countries and stored them in bonded warehouses. The State of Madras sought to levy sales tax on the turnover of goods supplied to foreign-going vessels, arguing the sales occurred within the state, while the company claimed the sales were in the course of export and thus exempt.","The court analyzed Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution regarding export sales and Section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 concerning the location of sales. It held that the appropriation of goods occurred in Tamil Nadu when segregated in the bonded warehouse, thus the sale was deemed to have taken place inside the State. The court determined that the sales were not 'in the course of export' as there was no destination for the goods to a foreign country, as they were for consumption on board the ship.","The appeals and petitions were dismissed, upholding the levy of sales tax by the State of Madras."

The court stated that it cannot rewrite the law to narrow the scope to only Indian currency notes when the legislature used the broader term 'currency note'. The court also clarified that the definition of 'currency note' in the Indian Paper Currency Act is specific to that Act and cannot be imported into the IPC.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, reversing the High Court's decision and remanding the case back to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the law."

    The  responden","The Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation appealed against a decision awarding compensation to the brothers of a deceased individual who died in a motor vehicle accident involving a corporation bus. The dispute centers on whether the brothers, as legal representatives, are entitled to compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, despite not being immediate family members as defined by the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855. The service involved is public transportation provided by the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.","The court analyzed Section 110A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, regarding legal representatives and its relationship to the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855. It considered the definition of 'legal representative' under Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and cited precedents like Megjibhai Khimji Vira v. Chaturbhai Taljabhai. The court interpreted 'legal representative' broadly, including those who suffer due to the death, and held that the Motor Vehicles Act supersedes the Fatal Accidents Act in cases of motor vehicle accidents.","The special leave petition filed by the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the brothers of the deceased are entitled to compensation as legal representatives."

The Board argued that the compulsory delivery was an acquisition, not a sale, and therefore not subject to purchase tax. The dispute also involved the Board's role as a trustee/agent and the taxability of export sales.","The court analyzed the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, in conjunction with the Coffee Act, 1942.

Act, 1956.
     It was  contended on  behalf of the State that what was
purchased as  fresh legs  was not  exported","The Deputy Commissioner of Sales-Tax appealed against Shiphy International, Alleppey, regarding the applicability of Section 5(3) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. Shiphy International claimed exemption from sales tax on exported frog legs, which were purchased fresh, then cleaned, skinned, and frozen to prevent decomposition before export. The dispute centered on whether the freezing process altered the frog legs into a different commodity, thus disqualifying them from the tax exemption.","The court relied on precedents like *M/s. Sterling foods. v. State of Karnataka and another* and *Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pio Food Packers* to determine if the processing (freezing) changed the fundamental character and identity of the frog legs. The court emphasized that processing alone doesn't necessarily create a new commodity; the key test is whether, in commercial parlance, the processed item is considered distinct from the original. The court distinguished *Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax and others v. A.B. lsmail and others* as involving a different scenario where slaughtering animals resulted in distinct products (meat, hides, skin).","The appeal by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales-Tax was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that frozen frog legs are the same commodity as fresh frog legs for the purpose of Section 5(3) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956."

annual increments.
     The ap","This case involves appeals by employees of the Irrigation Departments of Punjab and Haryana, challenging the Labour Court's decisions that their employer is not an 'industry' under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The employees' grievances stem from termination of services and denial of arrears of annual increments. The core issue is whether the Irrigation Department falls within the definition of 'industry' under the Act, thus entitling the employees to protection under labor laws.","The court analyzed the definition of 'industry' under Section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, considering that the amended definition (Act 46 of 1982) was not yet in force. It relied on precedents such as D.N. Banerji v. P.R. Mukherjee & Ors. and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa & Ors. to determine if the Irrigation Department's functions fell within the scope of 'industry'. The court applied the 'Dominant Nature' test to the Irrigation Department's functions.","The appeals were allowed, with the court holding that the Irrigation Department does fall within the definition of 'industry'. However, the court clarified that if the definition of 'industry' is changed in the future, the Irrigation Department can raise the issue again."

The State argued the sales were intra-state because the agreement stipulated delivery at the booking station.","The court considered Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, focusing on whether the movement of goods to another state was due to the sales contract. The court relied on Union of India & Anr. v. K.G. Khosla & Co. (P) Ltd. & Ors., [1979] 3 S.C.R. 453 at p. 460.

The dispute centered on whether Renusagar was Hindalco's 'own' source of electricity generation under the U.P.

The main grievance was the State's demand for electricity duty from Renusagar for the power supplied to Hindalco.","The court analyzed Section 3(1)(c) of the U.P. Electricity (Duty) Act, 1952, concerning 'own source of generation' and considered the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil. The court cited Life Insurance Corpn. Of India v.

The court interpreted that Renusagar, being a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary of Hindalco, should be treated as its alter ego.","The appeal against the High Court's finding was rejected, and it was held that Hindalco and Renusagar should be treated as one concern, with Renusagar's power plant considered Hindalco's own source of generation, making Hindalco liable for duty on that basis."

The sons of the Karta, acting as coparceners, filed a suit for a permanent injunction to prevent their father from alienating the property to a third party, arguing that the sale lacked legal necessity or benefit to the family estate. The core grievance is the potential loss of their share in the ancestral property due to the proposed sale.","The court analyzed Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, determining whether a coparcener could maintain a suit for a permanent injunction against the Karta. The court considered the Karta's power to alienate joint family property for legal necessity, benefit of the estate, or antecedent debts, citing precedents regarding the manager's authority. The court interpreted that granting a blanket injunction would unduly restrict the Karta's power and that coparceners have other remedies, such as challenging the alienation after it occurs.","The appeal was dismissed, and the High Court's judgment was affirmed, meaning the sons' suit for a permanent injunction was deemed not maintainable."

fresh  agreement was executed on May 2, 1981 and fresh  con-
nection of 45 KVA was given on",The Bihar State Electricity Board appealed a High Court decision that quashed bills and certificate proceedings against Green Rubber Industries. The dispute arose from the Electricity Board demanding minimum guaranteed charges from Green Rubber Industries after disconnecting their electricity supply due to non-payment. Green Rubber Industries argued they consumed no electricity during the billed period and the disconnection absolved them of further charges.,"The court analyzed the agreement between the Electricity Board and Green Rubber Industries, specifically clauses related to minimum guaranteed charges, disconnection for non-payment, and termination of the agreement. The court interpreted the agreement to mean that the liability to pay minimum guaranteed charges continued until the contract's determination, even after disconnection. The court held that the agreement was reasonable and valid and was not determined with the disconnection of supply.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that the Electricity Board was entitled to submit bills and demand payment for the minimum guaranteed charges until the contract's determination."

The petitioners contested the constitutional validity of the 46th Amendment Act, which empowered State legislatures to levy sales tax on certain transactions, and questioned whether this power was subject to restrictions under Article 286 of the Constitution.","The court examined the constitutional validity of the 46th Amendment Act and its impact on the power of State legislatures to levy sales tax on works contracts. It considered Article 366(29A) and Article 286 of the Constitution, along with Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule. The court also referred to several precedents, including State of Bombay and Another v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. and Others, and Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar & Others, to interpret the scope and limitations of the State's taxing power.",The court held that there was due compliance with the provisions of Article 368(2) regarding ratification of the 46th Amendment. It also ruled that sales tax laws passed by State legislatures on the transfer of property in goods involved in works contracts are subject to the restrictions and conditions mentioned in Article 286 of the Constitution.

","The Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India challenged the constitutional validity of the Hotel Expenditure Act, 1987, which imposed a 10% tax on chargeable expenditure in hotels with room charges of Rs. 400 or more per day per individual. The petitioners argued that the Act lacked legislative competence and violated Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, claiming it was essentially a tax on luxuries or sale of goods, not an expenditure tax.","The court analyzed the legislative competence of the Union Parliament under Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I, distinguishing the expenditure aspect of the transaction from taxes on luxuries or sale of goods, which fall under state power. The court cited several precedents regarding legislative powers and the interpretation of overlapping legislative fields, emphasizing that the subject of a tax is different from the measure of the levy. The court also addressed the classification of hotels for tax purposes, finding it rational and not violative of Article 14.","The Writ Petitions were dismissed, upholding the constitutional validity of the Hotel Expenditure Act, 1987."

Ltd. The Commission believed this representation was false and misleading to consumers. The dispute centers around whether using the product names 'National' and 'Panasonic' instead of the manufacturing company's name, Mitsushita, constitutes an unfair trade practice.","The court analyzed Section 36A(1)(i) and (v) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, focusing on whether the advertisement contained a false statement that misled a reasonable person. The court emphasized that the definition of 'unfair trade practice' is specific and limited, aiming to ensure honesty between manufacturers and consumers. The court considered whether the representation, though technically inaccurate, was misleading given that 'National' and 'Panasonic' are well-known brands of Mitsushita.","The appeal was allowed, with the court finding that the erroneous description of the manufacturing company in the advertisements did not constitute an unfair trade practice under Section 36-A of the M.R.T.P.

The dispute centered on whether octroi was chargeable when goods were brought within municipal limits but ultimately sold and consumed outside those limits. Parekh Automobiles sought a refund of octroi tax already paid.","The court relied on precedents like Burmah Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Co. Ltd. v. The Belgaum Borough Municipality and Hiralal Thakorelal Dalai v. Broach Municipality, which established that consumption is a prerequisite for levying octroi. The court interpreted Section 104 of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act and Rule 13 of the Rajasthan Municipal Octroi Rules, concluding that octroi was not leviable on goods re-exported outside the municipal limits for consumption elsewhere, especially when current account facilities were in place under Section 133.","The Supreme Court dismissed the Municipal Council's appeal, affirming the High Court's decision that octroi was not leviable on petroleum products re-exported outside the municipal limits; the Municipal Council was directed to refund the octroi duty to the Indian Oil Corporation."

The petitioner alleged irregularities in the CCI's approval process, including undue haste, deviation from guidelines, and inadequate consideration of RPL's financial soundness and security. The core issue revolved around whether the CCI properly exercised its power in granting the sanction and whether the debenture issue was detrimental to public interest.","The court analyzed the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947, emphasizing that while the Act doesn't explicitly define the CCI's role, the CCI must act in the public interest and ensure balanced investment. The court clarified that the CCI's guidelines are non-statutory and not judicially enforceable, allowing for discretionary departures. The court also noted that the CCI's duties should not be widened beyond the expeditious implementation of the Act and should be restricted to ensuring that the issue is not manifestly impracticable or financially risky as to amount to a fraud on the public.","The writ petitions and the suit challenging the CCI's sanction were dismissed, upholding the validity of the debenture issue."

The dispute concerns a 1965 agreement where Ramzan agreed to execute a sale deed for a mortgaged house in favor of Hussaini once she redeemed the mortgage. Hussaini redeemed the property in 1970, but Ramzan failed to execute the sale deed, leading to Hussaini filing a suit for specific performance in 1984.","The central issue was whether the suit was barred by limitation under Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The court interpreted ""the date fixed for the performance"" to include dates ascertainable by reference to a specific event (redemption of mortgage), applying the principle of *id certum est quod certum reddi potest*. The court distinguished the case from precedents where the date was too indefinite or dependent on third-party actions.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court and trial court judgments, and dismissed the suit, finding that the limitation period started running from the date of redemption."

through the latter's sales organisation in all the States of
India. In","Snow White Industrial Corporation appealed against the Collector of Central Excise, Madras, concerning the assessable value of their product, 'Supercem Waterproof Cement Paint,' for excise duty. The dispute centered on whether the agreement between Snow White and Gillanders Arbuthnot & Co. Ltd. was a sale or a sole selling agency agreement, impacting the price at which excise duty should be levied. Snow White claimed the assessable value should be based on the price at which they sold the goods to Gillanders, while the excise authorities assessed it based on Gillanders' selling price to customers.","The court analyzed the agreement's terms to determine if it constituted a sale or an agency. The court considered precedents regarding the distinction between a sale, where title transfers, and an agency, where the principal retains ownership. The court emphasized that the terminology used by the parties is not decisive and that the essence of a contract of sale is the transfer of title to the goods for a price paid or promised to be paid.","The appeal was dismissed, with the court upholding the Tribunal's finding that the agreement was one for agency and not sale. The court permitted the appellants to have the benefit of other deductions envisaged in Assistant Collector of Central Excise & Ors. etc. v. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd., subject to the order passed in the review matter."

On re","The State of Tamil Nadu appealed against Anandam Viswanathan regarding the assessment of sales tax on contracts for printing question papers for universities and educational institutions. The dispute centered on whether printing and block-making charges should be included in the assessable turnover, or if the contract was primarily for work and labor with incidental sale of paper. The State argued the entire amount should be taxed as a sale of printed materials.","The court analyzed whether the contract was for work and labor or for the sale of goods, citing several precedents to differentiate between the two. It emphasized the importance of determining the intention of the parties and the nature of the transaction. The court considered the confidential nature of printing question papers and the trust reposed in the printer, concluding that the primary aspect was the work done, not the sale of goods.","The appeals were dismissed, holding that the contract was primarily for work and labor, and sales tax was only applicable to the cost of the paper if it was separately identified in the demand notes."

This regulation allowed the DTC to terminate employees' services with one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof. The DTC Mazdoor Congress challenged the regulation, arguing it gave the management arbitrary power to terminate services, violating Article 14 of the Constitution.","The case primarily revolves around the constitutional validity of Regulation 9(b) in light of Articles 14, 16, 19, 21 and 311(2) of the Constitution of India, principles of natural justice, and Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872.

1. This appeal arises from the Judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 7.11.1974 in Regular First
Appeal Nos. 156-D and 167-D of 1963. The appellant, Sohan Lal, is the second defendant in the civil
suit instituted in the Court of the Senior Sub-Judge, Delhi by the second respondent herein, Jagan
Nath Bhayana. The first respondent in this appeal, the Union of India, is the first defendant in the
suit.
2. The main relief sought by the plaintiff in the suit was for possession of House No. 35, Block No.
21, Box-type tenement in West Patel Nagar, New Delhi, or in the alternative for specific performance
of sale of the aforesaid house, or for damages in the sum of Rs. 13,000/- together with costs. The
suit was dismissed by the learned Sub-Judge against the second defendant, Sohan Lal, the appellant
herein. But it was decreed against the first defendant - the Union of India - the first respondent
herein, to the extent of awarding damages in the sum of Rs. 13,069.31 with proportionate cost","The case involves a dispute over the possession and ownership of a house in New Delhi. Jagan Nath Bhayana (plaintiff) claimed he had a contract with the Union of India for the allotment and sale of the house, but it was later allotted to Sohan Lal (defendant). Bhayana sought possession, specific performance of the sale, or damages.","The court emphasized that no enforceable contract existed between the plaintiff and the Union of India as per Article 299 of the Constitution, which mandates specific conditions for contracts made in the exercise of executive power. Citing precedents like *Bihar Eastern Gangetic Fishermen Co-operative Society Limited v. Sipahi Singh and Ors.*, the court reiterated that failure to comply with Article 299 nullifies the contract. Furthermore, no contract existed between the plaintiff and Sohan Lal, precluding a decree for specific performance against him.","The appeal was allowed, and the High Court's decree for specific performance against Sohan Lal was set aside. The plaintiff retained the right to execute the decree against the Union of India for damages and costs previously awarded."

The dispute centered on the validity of the TAC's bye-laws imposing weighing dues on goods sold in the town area. Das argued that the dues were an illegal tax or a fee without quid pro quo, and discriminatory.","The court examined the United Provinces Town Areas Act 1914 and the U.P. Municipalities Act 1916 to determine the TAC's power to levy weighing dues. It distinguished between a tax and a fee, emphasizing that a fee requires a correlation between the amount collected and the service rendered. The court cited Avinder Singh v. State of Punjab regarding the scope of judicial review of tax legislation, noting that courts should not interfere with the policy of legislation unless it violates the Constitution.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the weighing dues were a valid measure of taxation."

Before the sale deed was executed, a third party attached the property in execution of a decree. The dispute concerns whether the sale to Sreedharan prevails over the attachment by the third party.","The court considered Order 38 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 40 of the Transfer of Property Act, and Section 91 of the Trusts Act, noting that an agreement for sale creates an obligation attached to the ownership of the property. The court held that the attaching creditor is entitled to attach only the right, title, and interest of the judgment debtor, and the attachment cannot override the contractual obligation arising from an antecedent agreement for sale. Several precedents from Madras, Calcutta, Bombay, and Travancore-Cochin High Courts were cited with approval, while a contrary view from Punjab & Haryana High Court was overruled.","The appeal was allowed, reversing the High Court's order and restoring the trial court's decision. The purchaser (Sreedharan) gets good title despite the attachment."

1. Pursuant to our order dated August 5, 1991, this matter has been brought up for a verification in
regard to the compliance of orders. Mr. Suri appearing for the petitioner says that 13 States and the
Union Territories have not filed their affidavits and these are: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu,
Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Pondicherry, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Punjab.
Maharashtra
2. So far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned counsel for the State files its affidavit in Court
wherein it has been stated that a new premises has been allocated within the city which is easily
accessible to the people and the office is being shifted. We allow three weeks' time for shifting. It is
further stated that instructions have been issued to the Chairman of the State Commission to
exercise administrative control over the subordinate forums. Assertion has been made in the
affidavits that all district forums have been set up and are at work. Petitioner states that Bombay
Suburb District Forum, though notified five months back, has not been functioning. Counsel for the
State undertakes, and we direct that the said District Forum, if not already operating, shall operate
from 1.11.91.

3. ","Common Cause, a registered society, filed a case against the Union of India and other states regarding the non-compliance of orders related to the establishment and functioning of District Forums and State Commissions under the Consumer Protection Act. The main grievance was the delay and non-cooperation from various state authorities in setting up these consumer redressal forums. The case concerns the effective implementation of consumer protection mechanisms across India.","The judgment focuses on enforcing the previous orders of the court regarding the establishment of consumer forums at the district and state levels, implying the application of the Consumer Protection Act. The court expressed its displeasure at the non-compliance and threatened contempt proceedings against defaulting state officials, emphasizing the statutory responsibilities of the states. No specific sections or precedents are explicitly cited, but the underlying principle is the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act's provisions for consumer redressal.","The court issued notices of contempt to officials from several states for non-compliance with previous orders, while discharging notices for states that demonstrated compliance. The case was adjourned to future dates for continued monitoring of compliance with the establishment and functioning of consumer forums."

The court interpreted Explanation 3(c) in conjunction with clauses (a) and (b), which expressly exclude inter-state sales and sales in the course of import or export. The court also considered the method of calculating taxable turnover under Section 5-B and Rule 6 of the Karnataka Sales Tax Rules, 1957.","The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellant, and the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, finding no substance in the appellant's contentions regarding the validity of the challenged provisions."

Chand Rani sued for specific performance, which was initially granted but later reversed by the High Court.","The court considered whether time was of the essence of the contract for the sale of immovable property, citing Gomathinayagam Pillai v.

The court also highlighted the Corporation's duty as a trustee under Section 29(4) and its obligation to act on business principles as per Section 24, citing precedents related to fairness and reasonableness in state actions. The court found that Section 29 does not exclude the principles of natural justice.","The appeal was allowed, and the sale of the property was set aside due to the Corporation's unjust and unreasonable actions. The Corporation was directed to resume possession, allowing the appellant to redeem the hypotheca by paying the liability, failing which the Corporation could sell it in open auction."

1. This appeal by special leave is preferred against the judgment of the High Court of Delhi at New
Delhi passed in R.F.A. (O.S.) No. 15 of 1975 dated 26.10.79, reversing the decree for specific
performance passed by the learned Single Judge in O.S. No. 463 of 1971.
2. The short facts leading to this appeal are as under:
On 26.8.71, an agreement for sale was entered into between Kamal Rani and Chand
Rani. This agreement was entered into through the husband of Chand Rani, Niranjan
Nath. Under the terms of the agreement, Kamal Rani agreed to sell her house and
property comprising of a freehold plot bearing No. 30 Block 'K', Green Park, New
Delhi (Village Kharera) measuring 311 sq. yards with a double-storeyed residential
building constructed thereon along with fittings and fixtures for a sum of Rs.
1,78,000 in f","This case involves a dispute over an agreement for the sale of immovable property between Kamal Rani (vendor) and Chand Rani (vendee). Chand Rani sued for specific performance of the agreement after Kamal Rani allegedly failed to complete the sale. The main grievance was Kamal Rani's claim that Chand Rani failed to pay Rs. 98,000 within the stipulated 10 days, making time the essence of the contract.","The court analyzed whether time was the essence of the contract, referencing Section 55 of the Contract Act and precedents like Gomathinayagam Pillai v. Pallaniswami Nadar. The court reiterated the principle that in the sale of immovable property, time is generally not considered the essence of the contract unless explicitly stated or clearly implied. The court also considered whether the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform their part of the contract.",Not available in document

The consumer alleged deficiency in service by IOC for refusing to regularize the connection despite knowing about the irregularities committed by its distributor. The consumer sought regularization of the gas connection and compensation.","The court analyzed Section 2(g) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which defines 'deficiency' in service. The court emphasized the absence of privity of contract between IOC and the consumer, as the relationship between IOC and the distributor was on a principal-to-principal basis, as evidenced by Clause 17 of the LPG distributorship agreement. The court also considered Section 3(2) of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation of Supply and Distribution) Order, 1988, stating that possession of LPG cylinders must be authorized.","The appeal was allowed, and the judgments of the lower authorities were set aside, meaning the consumer did not get the relief sought.

The petitioner contended that the appointment of the seventh non-service member was unconstitutional and that the respondent's blindness rendered him unfit for the role.","The court interpreted the phrase 'as nearly as may be one-half' in Article 316(1) as a guideline rather than a strict rule, allowing for some flexibility in the proportion of service members. It held that 'infirmity of body' under Article 317(3)(c) refers to a disability that prevents effective discharge of duties, not every physical limitation, and that the blindness in this case did not impede the respondent's ability to perform his duties effectively.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the appointment of Respondent No. 6 as a member of the Bihar Public Service Commission."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.M. SAHAI, J.- The question of law that arises for
consideration in these appeals, directed against orders passed by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission (referred hereinafter as National Commission), New Delhi is if the statutory
authorities such as Lucknow Development Authority or Delhi Development Authority or Bangalore
Development Authority constituted under State Acts to carry on planned development of the cities
in the State are ","The case involves appeals against orders passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission concerning statutory authorities like Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) and their housing activities. The dispute centers around issues such as delay in possession, non-completion of flats, and defective construction. The main grievance is whether these authorities are amenable to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for deficiencies in their housing services.","The court analyzed the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, particularly the definitions of 'consumer,' 'service,' 'goods,' 'deficiency,' and 'unfair trade practice.' It interpreted the term 'service' broadly, including housing construction, and emphasized that the Act aims to protect consumers' economic interests. The court cited precedents like Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps to support a wide interpretation of inclusive clauses in the Act.",Not available in document

Ferro Alloys, a manufacturer-exporter, routed its exports through MMTC under a barter system to encourage exports. The core issue is whether MMTC, which handled the export documentation and received letters of credit, or Ferro Alloys, which supplied the goods and received the payment, is entitled to the tax credit.","The court analyzed Section 280ZC of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which grants tax credit certificates to persons who export goods and receive sale proceeds in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The court determined that because the entire export was done through MMTC in accordance with the barter system, and statutory documents were made out in MMTC's name, MMTC is the exporter for the purpose of Section 280ZC. The court rejected the High Court's reasoning that Ferro Alloys was the 'real exporter' despite MMTC holding the title to the goods.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that Mineral and Metal Trading Corporation (MMTC) was the exporter for the purpose of Section 280ZC of the Income Tax Act, 1961."

The court also considered whether promotions exceeding the prescribed quota were valid and the applicability of the 1984 Rules and the Indian Forest Service (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966.

JUDGMENT
1. This appeal arises from the Judgment of the Madras High Court in a Sales Tax Revision Case. The
appellant is a co-operative sugar factory having its sugar factory at Chittur in Kerala State. Inasmuch
as sufficient quantity of sugarcane was not available within the State of Kerala, the appellant and the
Government of Kerala approached the State of Tamil Nadu for supply of sugarcane to the
appellant-factory. In pursuance of the understanding arrived at between them, the Government of
Tamil Nadu issued an order contained in G.O.M.S. No. 2260 dated July 20,1963. By virtue of this
order, the appellant was permitted to draw sugarcane from not more than 3,000 acres in
Coimbatore and Pollachi taluks in Tamil Nadu, subject to the conditions specified therein. Condition
No. 5 read thus:
(Clause (5) : The Co-operative Sugar Ltd., Chittur, should remit to this Government
the Sales Tax on the cane supplies made from areas in Madras State. The basis for
purposes of calculation will be taken as 3% of the purchase price of cane for a
recovery of 9.8% (Rs. 1.62 per maund)
2. In pursuance of the said order, appellant opened its offices at Coimbatore and Pollachi. The
sugarcane inspectors from these offices used t","The Co-Operative Sugar (Chittur) Ltd., a sugar factory in Kerala, appealed against the levy of purchase tax by Tamil Nadu sales tax authorities on sugarcane purchased from Tamil Nadu farmers. The appellant argued that the purchase was an inter-State sale under the Central Sales Tax Act, as the sugarcane was transported to their factory in Kerala, and thus not taxable under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act. The core dispute revolves around whether the sale of sugarcane occurred within Tamil Nadu or was an integral part of inter-state trade.","The court analyzed Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, particularly clause (a), which defines inter-State sales as those that occasion the movement of goods from one state to another. Citing the precedent in *Commr. of Sales Tax, U. P. v. Bakhtawar Lal*, the court emphasized that the movement of goods must be a necessary incident of the sale. The court determined that the purchase and transport of sugarcane were inextricably connected, making it an inter-State sale, regardless of where the sale technically occurred.","The appeal was allowed, and the assessment made upon the appellant by the Tamil Nadu sales tax authorities was quashed."

The petitioner argued that the respondents became co-sharers of the property through a collusive decree and were necessary parties to the suit. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the High Court upheld the dismissal.","The court considered Order 22 Rule 10, Order 1 Rule 3, and Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the CPC. It held that acquiring co-ownership through a decree during the suit's pendency is not an assignment, creation, or devolution of interest under Order 22 Rule 10.

The Hindustan Lever Employees' Union, along with other parties, opposed the merger, alleging statutory violations, procedural irregularities, undervaluation of shares, failure to protect employee interests, and violation of public interest. The core grievance revolved around the fairness of the merger terms, particularly concerning valuation of shares and protection of employee interests.","The court examined the merger under the Companies Act, 1956, specifically focusing on Section 391(l)(a). While the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 was mentioned, the court emphasized the distinct jurisdictions of the High Court under the Companies Act and the MRTP Commission. The court applied the 'prudent business management test' and considered whether the scheme was a device to evade the law, also emphasizing the need to consider public interest, especially when a foreign subsidiary is involved. The court cited Fertiliser Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., [1981] 2 S.C.R, 52, Buckley on Companies Act, and Palmer on Company Law.","The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, dismissing the appeal and finding no merit in the challenges to the merger. The court found that the merger was not against public interest, the valuation of shares was not prejudicial, and employee interests were adequately protected."

The dispute arose from demands made by the workmen and the Management's Notice of Change regarding the dearness allowance for monthly-rated clerical and technical staff. The main grievance was the company's desire to place a ceiling on dearness allowance, arguing that the neutralisation factor exceeded 100%.","The judgment primarily concerns the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, specifically Sections 10(1)(d) and 10(2), which relate to references of industrial disputes to tribunals. The court examined the existing dearness allowance formula and its impact on the wage structure, considering factors like neutralisation of the cost of living index and comparable industry practices. The Division Bench disapproved of the ceiling on dearness allowance, stating that the existing system did not result in over-neutralisation or distortion of incomes and that there were no compelling reasons to replace it.",The Division Bench of the High Court disapproved of the ceiling on dearness allowance and remanded the matter to the Tribunal for a fresh consideration of wage scale revisions. The court set aside the award regarding the revision of wage scales and directed the continuation of the existing dearness allowance system.

JUDGMENT:
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SAWANT, J.- The question that falls for consideration
in these matters is whether the 'medical representatives' as they are commonly known, are workmen
according to the definition of 'workman' under Section 2(s) of the industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the
'ID Act'). The definition under this section has undergone changes since its first enactment. It is
necessary to keep in mind the said changes since the decisions of this Court delivered on the point
from time to time are based on the definition, as it stood at the relevant time. The definition, as it
stood originally when the ID Act came into force w.e.f. 1-4-1947, read as follows-

JUDGMENT
N.P. Singh, J.
1. This appeal has been filed, against an order passed by the 'National Commission', established
under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, setting aside the orders passed by the State Commission
and the District Forum, and dismissing the petition of complaint filed on behalf of the appellant
against the respondent No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as 'the respondent').
2. The appellant booked a tractor with the respondent and deposited an amount of Rs. 2,500/- as an
advance on 12.12.1990. The price of the tractor was quoted at Rs. 1,86,975/-. The appellant was first
to receive the tractor from the said respondent according to the list of booking. On an application
made on behalf of the appellant, Allahabad Bank, Shahpur, sanctioned loan to the appellant, which
decision was communicated by a letter dated 5.2.1991.
3. Although in the list of the persons to whom ","Om Prakash booked a tractor with Haryana Agro and deposited an advance. Despite being first on the list, the tractor was delivered late, and he had to pay a higher price. He filed a complaint alleging unfair trade practice due to the delay.","The court analyzed whether the delay constituted an 'unfair trade practice' under Section 36-A of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, as defined by Section 2(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. While the amendment to Section 36-A covering unfair methods came into effect after the tractor's delivery, the court found the delay constituted a 'deficiency in service' under Section 2(1)(c)(iii) of the Consumer Protection Act.","The appeal was allowed, the National Commission's order was set aside, and the State Commission's order (directing refund and compensation) was restored."

It also considered Section 37 of the CPC, clarifying that an appellate court's decree is construed as the decree of the court of first instance. The court referenced conflicting views from the Bombay and Andhra Pradesh High Courts, ultimately siding with the Bombay High Court's view that such applications should be treated as originating from the original side of the court, even if initially filed on the execution side.","The appeal was dismissed. The court directed that the application should have been treated as an interlocutory application on the original side, but given the circumstances (deposit made while second appeal was pending, respondent in possession for a long time, execution mid-way), the court declined to interfere."

The petitioner is one of the defendants in the suit out of which the present special leave petition
arises. The plaintiffs are heirs of one Nand Ram, who is one of the five sons of one Jeevan Ram. The
petitioner belongs to the branch of Rakha Ram, another son of Jeevan Ram. Ganpat was a son of
Nanha Ram, still another son of Jeevan Ram.
2. The petitioner filed, at one point of time, Suit No.215 of 1973 which came ","The case involves a dispute over land ownership between Bhoop Singh and the heirs of Nand Ram. Bhoop Singh claimed sole possession based on a prior decree, while the plaintiffs (heirs of Nand Ram) sought a one-third share. The central issue is the validity and registrability of the prior decree obtained by Bhoop Singh.","The court analyzed Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, particularly sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) clause (vi), to determine if the decree required registration. The court examined various precedents concerning compromise decrees and family arrangements, focusing on whether the decree created new rights or merely recognized pre-existing rights. The court emphasized that if a document extinguishes rights of one party and confers rights in praesenti to another, it requires compulsory registration.",Not available in document

1. Occupational accidents and diseases remain the most appalling human tragedy of modem
industry and one of its most serious forms of economic waste. Occupational health hazards and
diseases to the workmen employed in asbestos industries are of our concern in this writ petition
filed under Article 32 of the Constitution by way of public interest litigation at the behest of the
petitioner, an accredited Organisation. At the inception of filing the writ petition in the year 1986,
tho","Consumer Education & Research Centre filed a public interest litigation under Article 32 of the Constitution concerning occupational health hazards and diseases faced by workmen in asbestos industries. The petitioner highlighted lacunae in laws applicable to the asbestos industry and sought remedial measures for protecting workers' health, including diagnosis and control of ""asbestosis"". The petition requested directions for maintaining health records, compulsory insurance, expert determination of permissible exposure limits, and re-examination of affected workers.","The court considered the ""Asbestos Convention, 1986"" (Convention 162 of the International Labour Conference (ILC)) and its various articles related to protective measures, exposure limits, monitoring, and workers' health. The court emphasized the obligations of employers to prevent and control exposure to asbestos, provide medical examinations, and maintain records. The judgment also refers to the International Labour Office's rules regarding safety in the use of asbestos and exposure limits.",Not available in document

1. The short question that arises for consideration in this appeal directed against judgment of
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, is whether a banking company
which renders service within meaning of clause (g) of Section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986 (referred in brief as 'the Act') is liable to compensate its customers for loss of service due to
illegal strike by its emplo","The Consumer Unity & Trust Society, Jaipur filed a complaint against the Chairman & Managing Director, Bank of Baroda, Calcutta, seeking compensation for customers who suffered losses due to a 54-day illegal strike by the bank's employees. The customers were deprived of banking services during the strike, leading to claims for interest on overdrafts, reimbursement of interest, and consequential damages.","The court analyzed Section 2(o) defining 'service' and Section 2(g) defining 'deficiency' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It held that while banking services fall under the Act, the deficiency in service must arise from the bank's failure to perform its duty. Since the strike, not the bank's negligence, caused the service disruption, Section 14(1)(d) regarding compensation for negligence causing loss or injury was not applicable.","The appeal was dismissed as the bank was not found negligent, and the loss to customers was a result of the employee strike, not a deficiency in service attributable to the bank."

system of labour. Civil appeals C.A.NO.5497 & 5504/95 arising out of SLP [c] Nos. 2613 of 1991 and
13520 of 1991 are filed by the managements, viz., Gujarat Electricity Board and M/s. Bihar State
Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation L","The Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) is appealing a decision that declared contract laborers working at its Thermal Power Station in Ukai to be employees of the GEB, not the contractors. The Hind Mazdoor Sabha & Ors, representing the laborers, argued that the contract system was exploitative and violated labor laws. The core dispute revolves around whether these workers are entitled to the same rights and benefits as direct employees of the GEB.","The central legal question is whether an industrial dispute can be raised for the abolition of the contract labor system, especially after the enactment of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. The court considered whether only the appropriate government has the power to abolish the contract labor system or if an industrial adjudicator also has jurisdiction. The court also examined whether the Industrial Tribunal or the appropriate Government has the power to declare the erstwhile workmen of the contractor to be the employees of the principal employer.",Not available in document

The central question is whether medical practitioners and hospitals/nursing homes can be considered as providing 'service' under Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and if so, under what circumstances.

The court splits the definition of 'service' into three parts: main, inclusionary, and exclusionary. The court also considers the definition of 'consumer' in relation to services and examines whether medical services fall within the scope of the Act, considering whether they are provided for consideration and not free of charge or under a contract of personal service.",Not available in document

Raheja Constructions later sought to amend the plaint to include a claim for specific performance, alleging they discovered the Charity Commissioner had granted permission for the sale. The respondents argued that the amendment was barred by limitation.","The court held that permission for alienation was not a condition precedent to filing a suit for specific performance. Since Raheja Constructions admitted the respondents refused to abide by the contract terms, they should have initially sought specific performance. Allowing the amendment after seven years would defeat the respondents' valuable right of limitation under Article 54 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963.","The court dismissed the petition, holding that the application for amendment was barred by limitation."

The respondents challenged these conditions as arbitrary, discriminatory, and violating Articles 14, 19(1)(g), and 21 of the Constitution. The specific grievance was against a condition limiting eligibility to persons in Government, Quasi-Government organizations, or reputed commercial firms.","The judgment analyzes the validity of the conditions imposed by LIC on its insurance policies, particularly Table 58, in light of Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. The court considered arguments based on the Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights, and the Directive Principles of the Constitution. The court also considered the actuarial principles and the Sezhivan Committee Report on improvement of Insurance.",The High Court declared a portion of the conditions under Table 58 as unconstitutional.

The dispute centers on whether sugarcane growers who are not members of cooperative societies but are required to supply cane to sugar factories under reservation orders are entitled to market price instead of the government-fixed price. The case also addresses the High Court's fixation of market price for 1993-94.,"The High Court's directions were based on the premise that non-members were not bound by the price fixed under bye-laws framed under the Cooperative Sugar Act and that the Zoning Order lacked a mechanism to hear non-members before price fixation. The judgment analyzes the necessity for government protection of the sugar industry and control over sugarcane supply and distribution, balancing the interests of sugar factories and sugarcane growers. The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, and the Maharashtra Sugar Factories (Reservation of Areas and Regulation of Crushing and Sugarcane Supply) Order, 1984, are examined in relation to price fixation and area reservation.","The document does not contain the final outcome of the appeals.

had issued a comprehensive insurance policy. The premium for the insurance was paid by the

After the car was transferred to the company, it requested the insurance policy be transferred as well, but received no response. The car was involved in an accident, and the insurance company denied the claim, arguing the company lacked insurable interest.","The court analyzed Section 103-A of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1939 (Old Act) and Section 157 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (New Act) regarding the transfer of insurance policies upon vehicle ownership transfer. Under the Old Act, the insurer had the right to refuse transfer within 15 days, while the New Act introduced a deeming provision for automatic transfer. The court determined that since the insurance company did not refuse the transfer request under the Old Act before the New Act came into force, the policy was deemed transferred under either Act.",The appeal was allowed. The court found that the Certificate of Insurance and policy described therein must be taken as complete in view of the language of Section 103A of the Old Act and Section 157 of the New Act.

1. Leave granted.
2. The respondent in the appeal herein purchased six National Savings Certificates (VI Issue) for Rs.
10,000 each on 28-4-1987 from the Post Office. The rate of interest payable with effect from
1-4-1987 was 11%. This was notified by the Government of India. Due to inadvertence on the part of
the clerical staff, the old rate of interest and the maturity value which was printed on the certificates
could not be corrected. The District Forum as well as the State Commission came to the conclusion
that the Government of India/Post Office were bound to pay the unconnected maturity value of the
certificates indicated on each of the printed certificates. The contentions raised by the learned
counsel for the Union of India that there was a notification issued by the Government of India
prescribing the rate of interest as 11% and that due to inadvertence on the part of the clerical staff of
the Post Office the printed maturity value was not scored off from the certificates, were not accepted
by the District Forum and the State Commission. The revision filed by the Union of India before the
National Commission was dismissed by a majority decision. Mr. Y. Krishnan, the dissenting
Member disagreed with the findings of the District Forum and State Commission and c","Raja Prameeelamma purchased National Savings Certificates from the Post Office, which mistakenly printed an incorrect (higher) maturity value due to an outdated interest rate. The consumer sought the higher maturity value, while the Post Office argued the correct interest rate was officially notified. This case concerns a dispute over the maturity value of National Savings Certificates due to a clerical error.","The dissenting member of the National Commission, whose reasoning was adopted by the Supreme Court, argued that the erroneous indication of a higher interest rate did not constitute a 'deficiency in service' under Section 2(1)(g) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The contract, represented by the certificates, was deemed unlawful and void because it contradicted the officially notified interest rate by the Government of India and was due to staff inadvertence. Therefore, the court found no deficiency in service based on either law or contract.","The appeal was allowed, and the orders of the District Forum, State Commission, and National Commission were set aside. As a result, the consumer's application was dismissed, meaning she was not entitled to the higher maturity value."

MMTC failed to supply the full quantity, citing issues with the foreign supplier, and the appellant alleged deficiency in service and sought damages under the Consumer Protection Act.

The court interpreted the exclusionary clause to mean that transactions where goods are purchased for commercial purposes, such as manufacturing and resale, are not covered under the Act. The court found that the appellant intended to purchase the G.P. sheets for commercial purposes, namely, to manufacture tin sheets for resale.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's decision that the transaction was commercial in nature and therefore not covered under the Consumer Protection Act."

1. The appellant is the widow of one Vijay Kumar Gupta, who had obtained a Policy for an assured
sum of Rs. 1 lakh from the respondent, Life Insurance Corporation of India (hereinafter 'the
Corporation'). The Policy was obtained on 1.4.1989 and two yearly premiums had been paid by
1.4.1991. As the third annual premium could not be paid within the grace period of a month
thereafter, the Policy lapsed on 1.5.1991. It however so happened that the Policy holder was
assassinated on 30.5.1991 at Chandigarh. A claim for the sum assured, alongwith an additional sum
equal to the sum assured, was lodged, as the Policy covered ""DAB"" (Double Accident Benefit) also.
The Corporation paid a sum of Rs. 1,13,9257- on 19.7.1991 which according to it was by way of ex
gratia payment, and taking a compassionate view the basic sum assured (Rs. 1 lakh), together with
bonus which had accrued (the total of which came to Rs. 1,13,925/-) was paid. The grievance of the
appellant is t","Smt. Shashi Gupta, the appellant, is the widow of Vijay Kumar Gupta, who held a life insurance policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). The policy lapsed due to non-payment of the third premium, and Vijay Kumar subsequently died in an accident. The dispute concerns LIC's refusal to pay the Double Accident Benefit (DAB) in addition to the sum assured and accrued bonus, which they paid as an ex gratia payment.","The court considered LIC's circulars regarding lapsed policies and the payment of the sum assured. While initially leaning towards interpreting the circular of 16.10.1987 in favor of the policyholder, the court acknowledged a subsequent circular of 4.1.1991 clarifying that DAB is not payable under lapsed policies even if the full sum assured is paid. The court did not explicitly cite any sections of the Consumer Protection Act, but considered the purpose of insurance policies and the need for a favorable interpretation for the policyholder where possible.","The appeal was allowed in part. The court ordered LIC to pay an additional Rs. 50,000 to the appellant on an ex gratia basis, considering the circumstances of the policyholder's death and the family's situation."

order dated hay 18, 1995, passed by the National Consumers Redressai Commission. New Delhi,
whereby the complaint of the appellant under the Consumer Protection Act. 1986 was dismissed on
the ground that the District Consumer Forum as also the State Commission had no jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon the claim pet","S.P. Goel filed a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the Collector of Stamps, Delhi, alleging deficiency of service for not registering a ""Will"" presented for registration, despite payment of registration charges. The Sub-Registrar impounded the document, considering it a Deed of Conveyance requiring higher stamp duty. The appellant sought registration of the ""Will"", a certified copy, and compensation for harassment.","The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held that the District Forum and State Commission lacked jurisdiction, as the appellant was not a ""consumer"" under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The court analyzed the definitions of ""consumer"" and ""service"" under Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(o) of the Act, referring to precedents like Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta and Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund vs. Kartick Das. The court distinguished the Consumer Protection Act from the Registration Act, 1908 and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which govern registration and stamp duty, respectively.","The revision was allowed, with the finding that the District Forum and State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim."

The Consumer Protection Council filed a complaint on behalf of the legal representatives of a deceased passenger who died in a bus accident, seeking compensation. The appellant contested the jurisdiction of the National Commission, arguing that the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 conferred exclusive jurisdiction on Claims Tribunals for motor vehicle accident claims.","The court analyzed the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, particularly Sections 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), 2(f), 2(g), 2(o), 3, 12, and 21, along with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, specifically Section 165, 166, 168 and 175. The court determined that the Motor Vehicles Act is a special law dealing with motor vehicle accident claims, while the Consumer Protection Act is a general law.

The core dispute revolves around the extent of DHL's liability for the loss, considering a clause in the consignment note limiting liability to US$100.","The court considered whether the National Commission could award damages exceeding the limits prescribed in the contract between the parties. It acknowledged the Consumer Protection Act's role in providing inexpensive and expeditious remedies but emphasized that parties are generally bound by the terms of a signed contract. The court held that while tribunals can decide on the validity of contract terms in certain cases, they cannot disregard specific terms agreed upon by both parties, especially when there isn't an acute dispute of facts requiring referral to a civil court.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's order that limited DHL's liability to US$100 as per the consignment note, with interest at 18% from May 25, 1990, until realization, and costs."

In this appeal by special leave, the question of importance arising therein is whether the alleged
breach of carrying humans in a goods' vehicle more than the number permitted in terms of the
insurance policy, is so fundamental a breach so as to afford ground to the insurer to eschew liability
altogether? Ancillary to the question is the poser : whether the terms of the policy of insuran","B.V. Nagaraju, the owner of a 'Tata' Truck, filed a claim with Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. for reimbursement of repair charges after his vehicle was damaged in an accident. The insurance company denied the claim, citing a breach of the policy because the vehicle was carrying more passengers than permitted. Nagaraju then approached the Karnataka State Consumer Redressal Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The court considered whether carrying more passengers than permitted under the insurance policy constituted a fundamental breach allowing the insurer to deny liability. The court relied on the precedent set in *Skandia Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Kokilaben Chandravadan & Ors.*, advocating for a 'reading down' of the exclusion clause to align with the main purpose of the insurance policy. The court reasoned that the extra passengers did not contribute to the accident, and therefore, the breach was not fundamental enough to void the insurance contract.","The appeal was allowed, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order was set aside, and the State Commission's order was restored, requiring the insurance company to pay the repair charges as estimated by their surveyor, along with interest and costs."

JUDGMENT
B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J.
1. Significant questions concerning the refund of Excise and Customs duties collected contrary to
law - in all its shades - arise for consideration in these appeals and writ petitions. They involve the
correctness of certain earlier decisions of this Court, concept of unjust enrichment, interpretation of
Article 265 of the Constitution of India and of the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act,
1944 and the Customs Act et al. As far back as August 14, 1984, Civil Appeal No. 1794 of 1984 and
the connected special leave petitions were referred to a Bench of seven Judges by a Bench of two
learned Judges, since the referring Bench doubted the correctness of the five-Judge Bench decision
in Sales Tax Officer, Benaras and Ors. v. Kanhaiyalal Mukundlal Saraf [1959] S.C.R. 1350. When the
matter came up before a seven-Judge Bench, it was brought to our notice that a seven-Judge Bench
has followed the decision in Kanhaiyalal in State of Kerala v. Aluminium Industries Limited (1965)
16 S.T.C. 689. Accordingly, the matters we","Mafatlal Industries Ltd. and others filed appeals and writ petitions against the Union of India and others concerning the refund of Excise and Customs duties collected contrary to law. The dispute involves the interpretation of Article 265 of the Constitution of India, the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, and the Customs Act, along with the concept of unjust enrichment. The main grievance revolves around the correctness of earlier decisions of the Supreme Court regarding refund claims and the validity of amendments to the relevant laws.","The judgment analyzes Sections 11A and 11B of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, as amended by Act 40 of 1991, focusing on the provisions related to recovery and refund of excise duties. It examines the legislative history of these sections, including prior rules governing refunds, and considers the impact of the amendments on refund claims. The court also considers precedents such as Sales Tax Officer, Benaras and Ors. v. Kanhaiyalal Mukundlal Saraf and State of Kerala v. Aluminium Industries Limited.",Not available in document

We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The only question for consideration is :
whether the respondent has been using the machine ""Brickman"" for clay preparation,
brick moulding, brick drying and brick burning, after purchasing the same from the
appellant for evening his livelihood within the meaning of Explanation to section
2(1)(d) of the consumer Protection Act, 1986? Section 2(1)(d) reads as under:
""Consumer"" means any person who:-
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been ","M/S. Cheema Engineering Services sold a ""Brickman"" machine used for brick production to Rajan Singh. The dispute is whether Rajan Singh is a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, specifically whether he purchased the machine for commercial purposes or for self-employment to earn his livelihood. The grievance is related to the machine's performance or defects, leading to the consumer court case.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, defining 'consumer' and the Explanation added in 1993 regarding 'commercial purpose' excluding self-employment. The court interpreted that 'self-employment' requires the purchaser to primarily use the machinery themselves (or with family members) for earning a livelihood, without employing regular employees for commercial trade. The burden of proof lies on the respondent (Rajan Singh) to demonstrate that the machine was used exclusively for self-employment.","The appeal was allowed, and the orders of all the Tribunals were set aside. The matter was remitted to the District Forum to record evidence and dispose of the case in accordance with the law."

This appeal by special leave arises from the order dated November 13, 1992 of the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi [the ""Commission"", for short] passed in First
Appeal No.62/1991.

Modi entered into a contract for the installation of a centrally air-conditioned plant in Modi's residence. Modi alleged deficiency in service and sought compensation of Rs.3,75,000/-. The appellant appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order, which held that proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act are not legal proceedings and the Commission is not a judicial authority, thus Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is not applicable.","The court analyzed Sections 3, 10, 16, 20, 13, 24, 25, and 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to determine if the forums created under the Act have the trappings of a civil court and judicial authority. The court considered precedents such as The Bharat Bank Ltd. Delhi vs. The employees of the Bharat Bank and Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs P.N.Sharma & Anr. The court interpreted the Act to mean that the District Forums, State Commission, and National Commission have all the trappings of a civil court and judicial authority, and the proceedings before them are legal proceedings.",Not available in document

what was in their store. The terrorists and/or disruptionists, bent on breaking the backbone of the

Several accused appealed against the framing of charges, while the State sought cancellation of bail for one of the accused. The core issue revolves around determining the ingredients of criminal conspiracy and the effect of the repeal of TADA.","The court analyzed Section 120-A of the Penal Code, defining criminal conspiracy, and examined precedents like R. vs. Hawkesley and People vs. Lauria to determine the necessary elements, including knowledge and intent to further an illegal act. The court considered whether mere knowledge of an intended illegal act is sufficient for establishing criminal conspiracy, or if evidence of acting in concert is required. The court also considered the effect of the repeal of TADA on the ongoing proceedings.","The judgment addresses legal questions regarding criminal conspiracy and the framing of charges, but the final outcome for each individual appellant (whether their appeal was allowed or dismissed, or whether bail was cancelled) is not explicitly stated in this excerpt. The court states it will examine the cases of individual appellants and express its view on bail cancellation, but that determination is not included in the provided text."

The order under appeal is passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in first
appeal against an order of the State Commission.
The order under appeal opens with these words:
""Although there is substantial force in the contention advanced by the learned
Advocate General, Mr. Thakore, appearing on behalf of the appellant, that the
question of pricing does not legitimately fall within the purview of adjudication by the
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forums, regard being had to the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case where only a very small period of about 10 months is
involved and the party concerned is a Gram Pa","The State of Gujarat appealed a decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission regarding a dispute between a Gram Panchayat and an electricity provider. The Gram Panchayat claimed entitlement to a subsidized electricity rate for supplying drinking water to residents from a bore-well. The State Commission had upheld the Panchayat's right to the subsidy, but the National Commission's order was appealed.","The Supreme Court found that the question of pricing did not legitimately fall within the purview of adjudication by the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forums. The court emphasized that if a court lacks jurisdiction, it lacks jurisdiction regardless of the parties involved or the amount in dispute. No specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act or other laws are explicitly cited, but the reasoning centers on the fundamental principle of jurisdictional limits.","The appeal was allowed, the order under appeal was set aside, and the claim made by the respondents (Gram Panchayat) before the State Commission was dismissed. There was no order as to costs."

JUDGMENT:
JUDGMENT The following Order of the Court was delivered : We have heard learned counsel on
both sides.
Both the appeals are heard and disposed of together since claims arising out of them arise out of the
same cause of action.
These appeals arise from the orders dated January 12, 1995 of the National Consumer Redressal
Commission (the ""Commission"", for short) made in Original Petition No. 62 and 102 of 1993.
Admittedly, the respon-dent was holding two policies. First policy covered the period from March
31,1986 to March 31, 1987 and the second policy covered the period from April 1, 1987 to March 31,
1988. During the said period, admittedly, due to the employees' strike the leather in process was
damaged due to the spoilage. The respondent laid claims for damages caused during the ","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Redressal Commission's order to pay M.K.J. Corporation for damages to leather stock due to a strike by employees, covered under two insurance policies. The insurance company argued that a clause based on recommendations from the Tariff Advisory Committee excluded coverage for losses resulting from cessation of work due to a strike.","The court emphasized the principle of utmost good faith in insurance contracts, requiring both parties to disclose material facts. The court found that the insurance company failed to incorporate the exclusionary clause from the Tariff Advisory Committee's recommendations into the policy, and therefore, the insured was not bound by it. The court held that since the policy covered damages due to strikes, and the surveyor confirmed the damage was strike-related, the insurance company was liable.","The appeals were disposed of, with the court modifying the interest payment period and rate to 12% per annum from January 1, 1991, but upholding the liability of the insurance company for the spoilage of leather caused by the strike. The claim for consequential loss was deemed rejected."

REDDY, J. Leave granted in Special leave Petitions, This batch of appeals and writ petitions raise
the question - whether the transfer of an Irnoprt License called R.E.P. Licence/Exim Scrip by the
holder thereof to another person constitutes: a sale of goods within the meaning of and for the
purposes of the Sales Tax enactments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. If it does, it is exigible
to sales tax. Otherwise not The Karnataka and Madras High Courts have taken the view that R.E.P.
Licences/Exim Scrips constitute goods and, therefore, on their transfer. sales tax is leviable. Their
judgment, appears to be influenced mainly by the decision. of this Court in H .Anaj Etc. v
.Government of Tamil nadu Etc, [ 985] Suppl. (3) ","Vikas Sales Corporation and others appealed against the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes regarding the levy of sales tax on the transfer of R.E.P. Licenses/Exim Scrips. The appellants contended that these licenses/scrips do not constitute ""goods"" under the relevant sales tax enactments and are therefore not subject to sales tax. The dispute centers on whether the transfer of import licenses qualifies as a sale of goods.","The court considered Entry 54 in List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, which empowers State Legislatures to make laws regarding taxes on the sale or purchase of goods. The court also examined the definition of ""goods"" in Clause (12) of Article 366 of the Constitution and Clause (7) in Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The Karnataka and Madras High Courts relied on the precedent set in H. Anraj Etc. v. Government of Tamil Nadu Etc. to determine that the licenses constitute goods.","The document does not provide the final outcome of the appeals and writ petitions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the appeal was allowed or dismissed."

2. Agricultural Market Committee (for short, 'the Committee') which is the appellant before us is a

1966 ('the Act') while the respondent is a licenced trader dealing in ""Copra"" (dried coconut kernel)
which it imports from various places in the State of Kerala for manufacturing coconut oil.
3. ""Copra"" is a notified agricultural produce and, therefore, the Committee has a right to levy and

within the notified area of the Committee.

Shalimar Chemical Works challenged the levy, arguing that the sale/purchase transaction occurred in Kerala, not within the Committee's notified area in Andhra Pradesh. The dispute centers on whether the weighing of the Copra within the notified area constitutes a sale within that area, making Shalimar liable for the market fee.","The court examined Section 12 of the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets Act, 1966, and its Explanation I, which creates a presumption of sale within the notified area if goods are taken out of it. The court found that Rule 74(2) and Bye-law 24(5), which extended this presumption to include weighing, measuring, or counting the goods, were beyond the scope of the Act.

","Ashok Leyland Limited, a truck manufacturer, challenged the reopening of sales tax assessments by the State of Tamil Nadu. The dispute centered on whether the transfer of vehicles from Tamil Nadu to the company's Regional Sales Offices (RSOs) in other states constituted inter-state sales taxable in Tamil Nadu, or mere consignments. Ashok Leyland argued that the sales were intra-state sales in the states where the RSOs were located and had already been taxed there, leading to double taxation.","The case primarily revolves around the interpretation of Section 6-A of the Central Sales Tax Act and the power to reopen orders accepting 'F' Forms. Ashok Leyland argued that Section 6-A creates a conclusive presumption upon proof of facts in Form 'F', preventing reopening under Section 16 of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act. The court had to determine whether accepting Form 'F' is conclusive and independent or part of the assessment order, and whether reopening is justified based on a mere change of opinion.",Not available in document

Sainani. Sainani, as assignee of insurance policies taken out by M/s Ajanta Paper and General Products Ltd., filed complaints alleging deficiency in service by the insurance company for not extending insurance cover during re-shipment of goods diverted to Muscat and repudiating the insurance claim due to shortage of goods.","The court considered the limitation period for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, referencing Article 44 of the Limitation Act, which provides a three-year limitation period from the date of denial of the insurance claim. The court interpreted clauses 8, 9, and 11 of the insurance policy to determine when the insurance cover terminated, particularly focusing on the requirement of prompt notice and request for continuation of cover when circumstances beyond the assured's control led to termination of the contract of carriage at a port other than the destination.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome of the appeal.

In this group of appeals identical grievance is made by the appellants who are consumers of
electricity supplied by the respondent U.P. State Electricity Board ( 'the Board' in short). Their
grievance is that though by notifications dated 29th October 1982, 13th July 1984 and 28th January
1986 the respondent-Board in exercise of its powers under Section 49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act,
1948 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') had held out a promise to new industrialists seeking to
establish industries in different parts of the State of Uttar Pradesh, that on the charges of electricity
consumed by them they will be given 10% rebate for a period of three years from the date of
commencement of supply of electricity to them for the ","Pawan Alloys and Casting Pvt. Ltd., along with other appellants, consumers of electricity supplied by U.P. State Electricity Board, challenged the premature withdrawal of a 10% rebate on electricity charges promised to new industries. The Board had initially offered the rebate under Section 49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, but later withdrew it, leading to writ petitions challenging the withdrawal notification.",The case primarily revolves around the doctrine of promissory estoppel and its applicability against the State Electricity Board. The court considered whether the Board's initial notifications created a binding promise and whether subsequent agreements between the consumers and the Board barred them from challenging the withdrawal of the rebate. The court also examined whether the impugned notification had retrospective effect.,Not available in document

The facts and circumstances which gave rise to this question are as follows. The respondent was
appointed by PRl as Scientific Glass Blower on 25.10.48. He continued to word as such till 11.5.76
when he was transferred to photography Documentation services on a post which was non-technical
and administrative. On 31.12.78 he attained the age of 58 years","The case involves a dispute between Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and K.G. Sharma, a former employee. Sharma was retired at the age of 58, which he contested, claiming entitlement to continue until 60. The central issue is whether PRL qualifies as an 'industry' under Section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, which would determine if labor laws apply to Sharma's case.","The court considered whether PRL is an 'industry' under Section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act, referencing the Bangalore Water Supply case for the definition of 'industry'. The court analyzed whether PRL's activities are analogous to trade or business and whether its research activities constitute a sovereign function, which would exempt it. The principle of 'noscitur a sociis' was applied to interpret the words 'undertaking', 'calling', and 'service'.",Not available in document

However, the Supreme Court, while acknowledging the complainant's claim before the Consumer Forum, focused on whether the allegations in the complaint and witness statements constituted the alleged offences under Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The court found the complaint vague and lacking specific evidence implicating the appellants in the forgery.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the Magistrate's order taking cognizance of the offences against the appellants, including two officers who did not file a special leave petition, concluding that the allegations did not constitute the alleged offences."

The common question that arises for consideration in all these appeals is whether a Pawn-broker is
a dealer and carries on 'business' within the meaning of the State General Sales Tax Act read with
the State Pawnbrokers Act and Rules when he causes the sales of unredeemed articles/goods,
occasioned by the default of the Pawner through (statutory) Auctioneer.
The above question has to be considered with reference to the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act read with the Tamil Nadu Pawnbrokers Act and Rules as well as the Karnataka Sales
Tax Act read with the Karnataka Pawnbrokers Act and Rules. We may point out that the relevant
provisions of both the Sales Tax Acts and the Pawnbrokers Act are substantially the same and for the
sake of convenience the provisions mentioned hereinafter are the provisions of the Karnataka Acts.
Before going into the submissions advanced at the bar, certain basic background facts need to be
stated.
Pawn-broker is a person who carries on the business of taking goods and chattels in pawn for a loan.
On payment of the money lent with interest and other admissible incidental expenses the

The dispute centers on whether the pawn broker should be liable for sales tax on these sales. The product/service involved is pawn-brokering.,"The court considered the provisions of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, Karnataka Pawnbrokers Act, and relevant rules, along with the Indian Contract Act. Key sections analyzed included the definition of 'business' and 'dealer' under the Sales Tax Act, and provisions related to redemption and sale of pledges under the Pawnbrokers Act. The court also examined the rights and liabilities of the pawner and pawnee under the Contract Act.",Not available in document

The dispute arose after a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed to resolve differences, but disagreements persisted regarding the valuation and division of assets, particularly concerning Modi Industries Ltd., Modipon Ltd., and Modi Spinning and Weaving Mills Company Ltd.","The primary legal question was whether Clause 9 of the Memorandum of Understanding constituted an arbitration agreement and whether the decision of the Chairman, IFCI, constituted an award under the Arbitration Act, 1940. The court analyzed the attributes of an arbitration agreement, referencing Mustill and Boyd's ""Commercial Arbitration,"" and determined that the Chairman's decision was not an arbitration award because the parties did not intend to refer disputes to arbitration, but rather sought clarification and decisions related to valuation under the MOU.","The Delhi High Court held that the decision of the Chairman and Managing Director, IFCI dated 8.12.1995 cannot be considered as an award in arbitration proceedings and dismissed the interim application. The Supreme Court heard appeals from these orders, along with a transferred case, to determine whether the MOU constituted an arbitration agreement and whether a suit filed by Group B was an abuse of process."

represented when the SLP had been called out on an earlier date, when it was adjourned due to its
absence. It is not represented today, even after the SLP has been passed over once.
3. The order that is under appeal was passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal

suits instituted before a regular civil court and not to complaints filed under the Consumer
Protection Act which is a special legislation intended to protect consumers in India against the
exploitation of manufacturers, traders and providers of service by supply of defective goods or by
deficiency in service resulting in loss to the consumer.""
The National Commission took the view that, inasmuch as the respondent was pursuing the remedy
available to it under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and had claimed that it had
hired the services of the appellant and there was deficiency in rendering such services, its complaint
was maintainable, for the protection given to an agent under Section 230 of the Contract","Marine Container Services South Pvt. Ltd. appealed against Go Go Garments' complaint filed under the Consumer Protection Act, alleging deficiency in service. Go Go Garments claimed to have hired the services of Marine Container Services, and suffered loss due to the deficiency. The dispute centers around the applicability of Section 230 of the Contract Act to proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act.","The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission erroneously held that the Contract Act, specifically Section 230 regarding agent liability, does not apply to complaints under the Consumer Protection Act. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the Contract Act applies to all litigants before the Commission, and an agent can invoke Section 230. The court found the National Commission's interpretation of Section 230 and its presumptions to be flawed.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the National Commission, and restored the order of the State Commission."

This disclosure led to the cancellation of his marriage and ostracization from his community. Mr. 'X' approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for damages, alleging a breach of medical ethics and confidentiality.","The court considered the duty of confidentiality arising from the Hippocratic Oath and the Code of Medical Ethics formulated by the Indian Medical Council under Section 33(m) read with Section 20A of the Indian Medical Council Act. While acknowledging the doctor-patient confidentiality, the court recognized exceptions where public interest, particularly the health risk to others, overrides this duty. The court also considered the right to privacy under Article 21 but found it was not absolute in this case.","The appeal was dismissed because the court held that the hospital's disclosure was justified due to the potential health risk to the appellant's prospective spouse, overriding the right to confidentiality in this specific situation."

complaining that the sum-flower seeds produced by the appellant and sold through the third

from the cost of seeds, a compensation of Rs. 5,000/- per acre from the appellant. The claim was
resisted, int","M/S Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co. Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's dismissal of their revision petition. The respondents, Alavalapati Chandra Reddy & Ors., filed a consumer complaint alleging that sunflower seeds purchased from the appellant did not germinate due to defects, seeking compensation for the cost of seeds and loss incurred.","The appellant argued that the Seeds Act, 1966, provides remedies, making the Consumer Protection Act inapplicable. They also contended that Section 13(1)(C) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding seed testing, was not followed and that the complainants were not consumers as the seeds were for commercial purposes. The Supreme Court left the question of law open regarding the applicability of the Consumer Forum but upheld the factual findings of the State Commission.","The appeal was dismissed based on the factual findings of the State Commission, without deciding on the legal question of the Consumer Forum's jurisdiction. No order was made regarding costs."

These tw","The case involves a minor, Harjol Ahluwalia, who suffered severe brain damage after being administered an intravenous injection (Lariago) at Spring Meadows Hospital. The parents filed a complaint alleging negligence and deficiency in service against the hospital, the nurse who administered the injection, and the insurance company. The primary grievance is the permanent vegetative state of the child due to the hospital's negligence.","The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission found the hospital negligent due to the unqualified nurse and the doctor's dereliction of duty, holding them responsible under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The hospital appealed, arguing that the parents could not claim compensation under Section 12(1)(a) and Section 14(1)(d) as the minor was the consumer. The court limited the notice to the award of compensation to the parents.","The document is truncated, so the final outcome of the appeal is not available. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission awarded compensation to the minor patient and the parents."

Explanation for the apparently inordinate delay in moving an application was accepted by the trial
court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, but the High Court in revision reversed the
finding and consequently dismisse","N. Balakrishnan (appellant) sued M. Krishnamurthy (respondent) for declaration of title, which was decreed ex-parte. The appellant's application to set aside the decree was dismissed for default, leading to a delay in reapplying. The appellant also filed a complaint against his advocate in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for deficiency in service.","The case primarily revolves around Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, concerning the condonation of delay. The Supreme Court cited Shakuntala Devi Jain Vs. Kuntal Kumari [AIR 1969 SC 575] and State of West Bengal Vs. The Administrator, Howrah Municipality [AIR 1972 SC 749] emphasizing a liberal construction of ""sufficient cause"" to advance substantial justice. The court held that the length of delay is not the primary factor, but rather the acceptability of the explanation for the delay.","The appeals were allowed, and the High Court's order was set aside, restoring the trial court's order, conditional on the appellant paying Rs. 10,000 to the respondent as compensation."

Construction Ltd. were competing bidders for a tender floated by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for the design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, and commissioning of large diameter pipes and steel tanks for a thermal power station. I.V.R. Construction challenged the Board's decision to award the tender to Raunaq International, arguing that Raunaq did not meet the qualifying criteria. The High Court stayed the operation of the Letter of Intent issued to Raunaq, leading to the present appeal.","The judgment primarily focuses on the principles governing judicial review of tender processes by public bodies and the elements of public interest involved in such contracts. It emphasizes that commercial considerations are paramount in awarding contracts and that courts should be hesitant to intervene unless there is evidence of mala fides, collateral motives, or a substantial public interest at stake. The judgment does not explicitly cite or apply any specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act or other consumer protection laws. The court emphasizes the need to weigh conflicting public interests before intervening in tender disputes.","The appeal was allowed, and the High Court's interim order staying the operation of the Letter of Intent issued to Raunaq International Ltd. was set aside."

The car had been sold before the accident, and the insurance company argued that the policy had lapsed because the transfer was not properly communicated by the original owner as required by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. The dispute centers on whether the insurance company is liable despite the transfer of ownership and the lack of formal notification from the transferor.","The court considered Section 103-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and compared it with Section 157 of the 1988 Act, referencing the precedent set in *Complete Insulations (p) Ltd.

The court emphasized that compulsory insurance is primarily for third-party risks and that the insurance company's liability to third parties persists even with incomplete policy transfers.","The document does not explicitly state the final outcome of the appeal. However, it implies that the appeal was likely dismissed, as the court upheld the principle that the insurance company remains liable to third parties despite issues with the policy transfer."

Appellant has been non-suited by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for
short, the 'National Commission') on appeal by the insurer against the order of the State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, the 'State Commission'). Both the National Commission
and the State Commission have been constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. By
judgment dated December 30, 1993 the State Commission had allowed the complaint of the
appellant and had directed the respondent-insurer to pay to the complainant-appellant a sum of
Rs.2,70","Ashok Gangadhar Maratha filed a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission after Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. refused to honor a claim for damages to his insured Swaraj Mazda truck. The insurer argued that the driver did not have a valid license to drive a transport vehicle, leading to a breach of the insurance policy. The National Commission sided with the insurer, prompting Maratha to appeal to the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 3 and Section 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, focusing on the definitions of ""motor vehicle,"" ""driving license,"" ""transport vehicle,"" and ""light motor vehicle."" The court interpreted ""light motor vehicle"" to not always mean a ""light goods carriage"" and considered the absence of a transport permit under Section 66. The court also considered Rule 2(e) of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, which defines ""non-transport vehicle.""","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the National Commission's judgment. The court determined that the vehicle was a light motor vehicle and the driver possessed a valid license for such a vehicle, thus reinstating the State Commission's order."

The arguments centered around whether the Minister's actions should be considered the act of the Central Government and whether Article 32 jurisdiction extends to awarding damages for 'tort of misfeasance in office' as opposed to violations of Fundamental Rights. The applicability of the Consumer Protection Act is not mentioned in the provided text.,The document is a review petition of prior judgments where Captain Satish Sharma was directed to pay exemplary damages.

Bhim Singh was insured under LIC's ""Salary Savings Scheme,"" where DESU was responsible for deducting premiums from his salary and remitting them to LIC. The dispute arose because DESU deducted premiums but failed to remit them, leading LIC to deny the claim.","The case was filed under Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The court analyzed the ""Salary Savings Scheme"" and determined that DESU, as the employer, had the sole responsibility to collect and remit premiums to LIC. The court found that placing the onus on the employee to ensure remittance, given the scheme's structure, would be too onerous.","The Supreme Court affirmed the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order, holding DESU liable to pay Rs. 50,000 with interest to Basanti Devi, while absolving LIC of any liability."

Parry (I) Ltd and Thiru Arooran Sugars Ltd., sugar manufacturers, appealed against the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes' decision to include planting and transport subsidies in their taxable turnover under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959. The dispute centered on whether these subsidies, paid to sugarcane growers, should be considered part of the price of sugarcane and thus subject to sales tax. The manufacturers argued that these subsidies were separate from the sale agreement and should not be included in their taxable turnover.","The judgment analyzes the Madras Sugar Factories Control Act, 1949, the Rules framed thereunder, and the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966, to determine the nature of the planting and transport subsidies. The court considered whether these subsidies were directly linked to the sale of sugarcane or were independent agreements. The court also examined the definition of 'price' under the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, and whether the subsidies could be considered part of the price paid for sugarcane.",Not available in document

JUDGMENT 1999 (2) SCR 476 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. VENKATASWAMI,
J. An important question of law under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (hereinafter called `the Act')
has arisen for our consideration in this appeal.
The question is whether the Insurance Policy lapses and consequently the liability of the insurer
ceases when the insured vehicle was transferred and no application/intimation as prescribed under
section 103A of the Act was made/given.
We find from the case law cited before us at the bar that there are conflicting views among the High
Courts on this issue. ","G. Govindan purchased a bus from the fourth respondent, but neither party informed New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (the insurer) of the sale as required by Section 103A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. An accident occurred involving the bus, and the respondents 2 and 3 claimed compensation. The dispute centers on whether the insurance policy lapsed due to the lack of notification, thereby absolving the insurer of liability.","The court considered conflicting views among High Courts regarding the interpretation of Section 103A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, specifically whether the insurance policy lapses upon transfer of the insured vehicle without proper notification. The court analyzed Section 95(5) and Section 31 of the Act, referencing the Andhra Pradesh High Court's Full Bench judgment in Madineni Kondaiah & Ors. etc. v. Yaseen Fatima & Ors. etc., AIR (1986) A.P. 62.

Backward Classes in the State of Kerala and the implementation of the law declared and directions
issued in Indira Sawhney Vs. Union of India ( 1992 (Suppl) 3, SCC 217). The State of Kerala took
time for implementation of the directions in Indira Sawhney for appointment of a Commission for
the purpose of identifying the creamy layer in the State but it failed to appoint a Commission or to
proceed with the implementation. Indira Sawhney was decided in 1992. For more than three years
the State of Kerala did not implement the judgment. This Court by its order dated 10.7.1995 held ( in

The State of Kerala failed to appoint a Commission to identify the creamy layer, leading to the enactment of the Kerala State Backward Classes Act, 1995, which declared that no creamy layer existed in the state. This Act was challenged as discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.","The court analyzed Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, emphasizing that while reservation is permissible for backward classes, it cannot be based solely on caste. The court reiterated the principle established in the original Indira Sawhney case that the 'creamy layer' must be excluded from the benefits of reservation to ensure that the benefits reach the truly backward. The court examined whether the Kerala Legislature could undo the law declared in Indira Sawhney by a retrospective validating law.",Not available in document

(ICICI) appealed against a judgment of the Calcutta High Court which held that the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) lacked jurisdiction to grant ad interim ex parte orders of injunction or stay against Grapco Industries Ltd. and others in a debt recovery application. The dispute centered on whether the DRT, established under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, could issue ex parte orders.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 22 of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, noting that while the DRT is not bound by the Code of Civil Procedure, it must adhere to principles of natural justice. The court distinguished the case from Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das, which involved the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, where no provision existed for interim relief. The Supreme Court held that DRT has the power to grant ex parte orders.",The Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court's reasoning and held that the Tribunal has the power to grant ex parte orders.

The State Commission initially passed an ex parte order in favor of the appellants after the hospital failed to appear despite notice. The hospital then filed an application to set aside the ex parte order, which was granted by the State Commission, leading to the current appeal.","The Supreme Court focused on whether the State Commission had the jurisdiction to set aside its own ex parte reasoned order under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Court noted the absence of any provision in the Act granting such power to the State Commission, distinguishing the case from precedents where the opponent had not filed a written statement. The Court held that the State Commission erred in assuming jurisdiction it did not possess, even considering the Bombay High Court's observation about approaching the State Commission if permissible under the law.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the State Commission's order that had set aside the original ex parte order, and restored Miscellaneous Application No. 31 of 1996 to the file of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for disposal in accordance with law."

This appeal was disposed of by us by our judgment dated 12th August, 1999.
Mr. R.N. Keswani, appearing on behalf of the appellant, has filed the instant Application stating that
he was the only counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant on 12.8.1999, but since he was busy in
some other Court when the matter was taken up by us, he could not come and argue the appeal. He
also stated that the counsel who was deputed to make a mention that he (Mr. R.N. Keswani) was
busy in some other Court was not entitled to argue the appeal.
Kalpavruksha Charitable Trust v","Kalpavruksha Charitable Trust appealed against a decision that it was not a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding machinery installed for commercial purposes. The dispute centers around whether the Trust, a charitable organization providing CT scans and other diagnostic services for a fee (mostly), qualifies as a consumer when purchasing the machinery for those services.","The court considered Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, defining 'consumer' and cited Laxmi Engineering Works vs. P.S.G. Industrial Institute (1995) 3 SCC 583, emphasizing that whether a purchase is for 'commercial purpose' is a question of fact. The court distinguished the case from precedents under the Income Tax Act, focusing on whether the machinery was obtained for resale or commercial purpose, and not on the charitable nature of the Trust.","The appeal was dismissed, and the court maintained its original judgment that Kalpavruksha Charitable Trust was not a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as the machinery was used for commercial purposes."

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 22nd November, 1995 passed by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short, 'the National
Commission').
The respondents had approached the Commission with the complaint that the appellants who were
developers and had promised, under a written agreement dated 27.1.1987, to provide a flat to them,
had failed to do so and, therefore, they were guilty of ""deficiency in service."" It was indicated in the
complaint that the respondents who were, at that time, in Libya and wanted to settle in India, had
Lata Co","Lata Construction, the appellant, failed to provide a flat to Dr. Rameshchandra Ramniklal Shah, the respondent, as promised in a written agreement. The respondent filed a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission alleging deficiency in service. The appellant argued that the claim was time-barred and that the subsequent agreement substituted the original one, precluding the consumer complaint.","The court considered Section 24-A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 regarding limitation period and Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act concerning novation of contract. The court held that the cause of action was a continuing one because the rights under the original agreement were not relinquished by the respondent, and the subsequent agreement did not entirely substitute the original contract as full payment was not made. The court also cited Lucknow Development Authority v. M.M. Gupta (1994) 1 SCC 243.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's decision. The appellant was required to pay the decreed amount, including compensation for pain and suffering, as the entire amount due had already been paid to the respondents."

Martins & Anr (developers) and Mrs. Mafalda Maria Teresa Rodrigues (complainant) regarding the non-execution of a sale deed for a flat in Perpetual Apartments, despite full payment by the complainant. The complainant also alleged sub-standard construction requiring repairs, and sought specific performance of the agreement.","The primary legal issue was the limitation period for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act before the insertion of Section 24A. The court held that prior to the amendment introducing Section 24A, the Act did not prescribe a limitation period, and the provisions of the Limitation Act could not be applied by implication. The court also considered the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act, which is to protect consumer rights.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the State Commission's direction for specific performance of the agreement, meaning the developers were required to execute the sale deed."

These two Appeals by the grant of Special Leave and arising out of the Judgment of the Delhi High
Court focus two singularly singular questions pertaining to (i) the time being the essence of the
contract and (ii) authority of the High Court in the matter of interference with an Arbitral Award
under the Repealed Act of 1940 (The Arbitration Act, 1940). For effectual disposal of these two
questions, noticed above, reference to certain factual details in this judgment is inevitable and
adverting thereto it appears that on October 4, 1989 Union of India floated an invitation to tender
for purchase of sugar to meet the urgent requirement of anticipated scarcity in the Indian market
during the Dussehra and Diwali festivals in November, 1989 which however, and without much of a
factual narration, culmi","M/S. Arosan Enterprises Ltd. and Union of India & Anr. are in dispute over a contract for the supply of sugar. The Union of India floated a tender for sugar, and Arosan Enterprises was contracted to supply 58000 metric tonnes. The dispute arose after the contract was initially cancelled by the Union of India, then withdrawn, and subsequently cancelled again, leading to the forfeiture of Arosan's performance bank guarantee.","The judgment primarily focuses on whether time was of the essence of the contract and the extent to which the High Court can interfere with an arbitral award under the Arbitration Act, 1940. It analyzes the conduct of both parties, particularly regarding the extension of the delivery period and the establishment of the Letter of Credit. The court examines the arbitrators' findings regarding the breach of contract and the legality of forfeiting the performance bank guarantee. No specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act are mentioned; the case revolves around contract law and arbitration.","The initial appeal to the High Court resulted in the arbitral award being set aside, but this decision was challenged. The Supreme Court ultimately considered the matter, but the final outcome (whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed) and any specific relief granted are Not available in document."

Respondent-Bank had taken two insurance policies with the appellant-company out of which one
was a cash insurance policy for Rs. I lakh and the second was a burglary insurance policy for Rs. 25

Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order regarding a burglary claim by Samayanallur Primary Agricultural Coop. Bank. The bank claimed for loss of pledged jewellery and cash due to burglary, based on two insurance policies. The dispute centered on whether the loss from a ""cashier's cash box"" was covered under a policy that insured valuables kept in a ""safe"".","The court held that the insurance policy should be construed based on its stipulations and the proposal form, which specified that valuables were secured in a ""safe"" made by Tansi. The court rejected the National Commission's reliance on dictionary definitions of ""safe,"" stating that the parties' understanding of the term at the time of the agreement was paramount. Since the burglary occurred from a ""cashier's cash box"" and not the specified safe, the loss was not covered by the policy. No specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act are explicitly mentioned, but the case revolves around interpreting the terms of an insurance contract within the context of consumer protection.","The appeal was allowed, the order of the National Commission was set aside, and the order of the State Commission (dismissing the bank's complaint) was restored."

against the Provident Fund Commiss","The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner appealed against Shiv Kumar Joshi, a member of the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, who filed a complaint alleging deficiency in service due to delayed payment of his provident fund. Joshi sought damages for the delay, while the Commissioner argued that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, did not apply as Joshi was not a 'consumer' and the provident fund scheme was not a 'service'. The District Forum, State Commission, and National Commission all ruled in favor of Joshi.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d) defining 'consumer' and Section 2(1)(o) defining 'service' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It referred to precedents like Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta and Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Pas to interpret the scope of 'consumer' and 'service' as encompassing a wide range of beneficiaries and facilities. The court considered whether the Provident Fund Commissioner's duties constituted a 'service' and whether delayed payment amounted to a 'deficiency in service'.",Not available in document

JUDGMENT:
BANERJEE, J The doctrine of equality as enshrined in the Constitution promised an egalitarian
society and the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 is the resultant effect of such a
constitutional mandate having its due focus in that perspective. This Court in Minerva Mills' case (
AIR 1980 SC 1789) in no uncertain terms laid down that the equality clause in the Constitution does
not speak of mere formal equality before the law but embodies the concept of real and substantive
equality which strikes at the inequalities arising on account of vast social and economic
differentiation and is thus consequently an essential ingredient of social and economic justice. In
short, this Court has equated the security clause in the Constitution so as to mean that the people of
the country ought to be secured of socio-economic justice by way of a fusion of Fundamental Right
and Directive Principles of State Policy. As a matter of fact this Court has been candid enough on
more occasions than one and rather, frequently to note that socialism ought not to be treated as a
mere concept or an ideal, but the same ought to be practised in every sphere of life and be treated by
the law courts as a constitut","The Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) appealed against a High Court order directing reinstatement of Safai Karamcharis (sanitation workers) who were engaged through a contractor. The dispute arose after the workers claimed entitlement to permanent absorption after completing 240 days of work. The core issue revolves around whether a direct employer-employee relationship existed between HSEB and the workers, despite the presence of an intermediary contractor.","The court considered the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970, and the constitutional mandate for social and economic justice, referencing Article 39(a) regarding adequate means of livelihood. The court applied the doctrine of 'lifting the veil' to determine the true employer, citing Hussainbhai Vs. Alath Factory Tezhilali Union to emphasize that the economic control over workers' subsistence determines the employer-employee relationship, regardless of intermediate contractors. The court interpreted the Act to regulate and, in certain cases, abolish contract labor to prevent exploitation and ensure fair working conditions.","The High Court's decision directing reinstatement of the workers was upheld, though the specific outcome of the appeal (allowed/dismissed) is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The workers were ordered to be reinstated with continuity of service, but without back wages."

members (Bala Krishna Eradi, J.), the appellant has moved this Court for modifying the majority

One lakh deposited for collection in 1983. Sovintorg claimed SBI failed to deposit the proceeds into their account for seven years, leading to business losses and mental agony. The dispute centers around banking services and the alleged negligence of SBI in handling the deposited cheque.","The court considered Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 14 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding interest on delayed payments and compensation. While Section 34 CPC was not directly applicable, the court noted that principles of justice, equity, and good conscience allow Consumer Forums to grant interest. The court also cited precedents like Satinder Singh and Ors. Vs. Amrao Singh & Ors. and Laxmichand Vs. Indore Improvement Trust, Indore and & Ors. to support awarding interest on equitable grounds.","The appeal was partly allowed, modifying the orders of the State Commission and National Commission. The court directed SBI to pay Sovintorg Rs. One lakh with interest at 15% per annum with quarterly rests from the date the amount was received until the date of payment."

Dany Dairy and Food Engineers Ltd., but the bank delayed payment, leading to the complaint.","The court analyzed Section 2(g) and 2(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, defining 'deficiency in service' and 'service' respectively. It also considered Section 14 regarding compensation for loss or injury due to negligence. Citing Consumer Unity & Trust Society v. Bank of Baroda, the court emphasized that deficiency must arise from the bank's failure to perform its duty and that negligence must cause the loss. The court also considered the impact of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA) on the remittance of foreign exchange.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, holding that there was no deficiency in service by the bank. The orders of the National Commission and the State Commission were set aside."

The dispute arose after the insured accepted the insurance claim amount with a discharge voucher, but later claimed interest for the delay. The case concerns insurance policies and the alleged deficiency in service due to delayed claim settlement.","The court considered whether accepting a full and final settlement and executing a discharge voucher prevents further claims, particularly for interest. While the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 doesn't explicitly authorize interest awards, the court, citing Sovintorg (India) Ltd. Vs. State Bank of India, held that forums and commissions can grant reasonable interest in appropriate cases. However, the court clarified that a discharge voucher only bars further claims if it wasn't obtained through fraud, undue influence, misrepresentation, or coercive bargaining.","The appeals were allowed, setting aside the National Commission's orders and confirming the State Commission's dismissal of the complaints, as the discharge vouchers were executed voluntarily without allegations of fraud or coercion."

These are judgment- debtors two appeals against common judgment dated December 24, 1997 of
the Madras High Court, passed in revision of the order of the executing court dismissing execution
applications filed by the respondent decree-holders. The decrees are for specific performance of two

into two separate but similar agreements of sale dated February 16, 1980 with the respondent
decree-holders. Since the judgment-debtor failed to perform his part of the agreements,
decree-holders filed suits for specific performance of the contract of sale in the court of the District

the sale-deeds. The suits were decreed on January 31, 1983 and the balance consideration amount
was to be deposited on or before March 31, 1983. Against the judgment and order decreeing the suits

Leave granted in SLP(C) No.18897/99. In this batch of appeals, Ghaziabad Development Authority
constituted under Section 4 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 is the
appellant. The Authority has from time to time promoted and advertised several schemes for
allotment of developed plots for construction of apartments and/or flats for occupation by the
allottees. Several persons who had subscribed to the schemes approached different forums
complaining of failure or unreasonable delay in accomplishing the schemes. Some have filed
complaints before the Monopoly and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission and some have raised
disputes before the Co","Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) appealed against orders from various forums (MRTP Commission, Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, High Court) directing refunds with interest to individuals who subscribed to GDA's schemes for allotment of developed plots/flats. The allottees complained of unreasonable delays or failure by GDA in completing the schemes. The core dispute revolves around GDA's failure to deliver on its promises and the subsequent claims for refunds and compensation.","The court considered whether compensation for mental agony and interest could be awarded in the absence of a specific contract. While compensation for mental agony was generally disallowed based on contract law principles, the court acknowledged the possibility of awarding interest on equitable grounds, citing the Sovintorg (India) Ltd. case. The court referenced Section 34 of the CPC, stating that while not directly applicable, its principles of justice, equity, and good conscience could authorize redressal forums to grant interest.","The Supreme Court partly allowed the appeals, setting aside the compensation for mental agony awarded by the MRTP Commission. The court modified the interest rate from 18% to 12% per annum in most cases, directing GDA to refund the amounts deposited with the revised interest."

The question arising for decision in these appeals is whether the transactions involved in
manufacture and supply of ships by the appellant to its customers are a sale as defined in clause (n)
of Section 2 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereinafter the Act, for short) as
held by the High Court or a works contract as defined in clause (t) of Section 2 of the Act and hence
not exigible to sales-tax as contended by the assessee-appellant.
M/s. Hindustan Shipyard Limited, the appellant before us, is a public sector undertaking. It is
engaged in the activity of building ships for different ship owners under the orders placed by them
and as evidenced by the contracts entered into between them.
The facts in brief. Between the assessment years 1974-75 and 1983-84 (both years inclusive) there
were 18 ships involved and formed s","M/s. Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. (appellant) and the State of Andhra Pradesh (respondent) were in dispute over whether the transactions involving the manufacture and supply of ships by the appellant to its customers constituted a 'sale' or a 'works contract' under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957. The assessing authority had deemed the transactions as sales liable to sales tax, a decision challenged by the appellant.","The core issue revolved around interpreting clauses (n) and (t) of Section 2 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, which define 'sale' and 'works contract' respectively. The court considered precedents like *Union of India Vs. The Central India Machinery Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (CIMMCO) & Ors.* to distinguish between a contract of sale and a works contract, emphasizing that the intention of the parties, derived from an overall reading of the contract terms, is crucial. The court also considered previous decisions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, including *Hindustan Shipyard Limited, Visakhapatnam Vs. The Commercial Tax Officer, Visakhapatnam* and *P.S. & Co. Vs.

PHUKAN,J, This appeal is directed against the order dated 08.01.97 passed by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission whereby the Commission set aside the order passed by
the State Commission of Rajasthan in the appeal filed by the respondent.
The appellant has a factory wherein it manufacturers high tension insulators for transmission lines.
The appellant had taken out an insurance policy known as 'All Risk Insurance Policy' for Rs. 50
lakhs tor installation of 25 M3 kiln ","M/S Modern Insulators Ltd. filed a claim with The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. under an 'All Risk Insurance Policy' for damage to kiln furniture and insulators during trial and testing. The insurance company rejected the claim, arguing the damaged property wasn't covered and later that the policy terms were violated by using used kiln furniture. The State Commission ruled in favor of the insured, but the National Commission reversed this decision.","The Supreme Court emphasized the fundamental principle of utmost good faith in insurance contracts, requiring both parties to disclose all material facts. The Court found that the insurance company failed to communicate the exclusion clause regarding second-hand property to the insured, thus could not claim its benefit. Additionally, the Court held that the National Commission erred in accepting a new plea raised by the insurance company that was not initially presented before the State Commission.","The appeal was allowed, the judgment of the National Commission was set aside, and the judgment of the State Commission was restored, meaning the insurance company was ordered to indemnify the loss."

The court noted that while Section 13 of the Act grants District Forums powers similar to civil courts under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), the provisions of Order 9 CPC, specifically Rule 9(1) regarding the prohibition of a second suit after dismissal for default, were not explicitly made applicable to consumer protection proceedings. The court held that absent a specific provision prohibiting a second complaint after dismissal for default, the rule of prohibition in Order 9, Rule 9(1) CPC, cannot be extended to proceedings before consumer forums.",Not available in document

L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J The main issue posed in this appeal has sequential
importance for members of the legal profession. The issue is this: Has the advocate a lien for his fees
on the litigation papers entrusted to him by his client? In this case the Bar Council of India, without
deciding the above crucial issue, has chosen to impose punishment on a delinquent advocate
debarring him from practicing for a period of 18 months and a fine of Rs.1000/-. The advocate
concerned was further directed to return all the case bundles which he got from his client
respondent without any delay. This appeal is filed by the said advocate under Section 38 of the
Advocates Act, 1961.
As the question involved in this appeal has topical importance for the legal profession we heard
learned counsel at length. To appreciate the contentions we would present the factual backdrop as
under:
Appellant, now a septuagenarian, has been practicing as an advocate mostly in the
courts at Bhopal, after enrolling himself as a legal practitioner with the State Bar
Council of Madha Pradesh. According to him, he was appointed as legal advisor to
the Madhya Pradesh State Co- operative Bank Ltd. (Bank, for short) in 1990 and the
Ban","R.D. Saxena, an advocate, appealed against a Bar Council of India decision that found him guilty of professional misconduct for not returning case files to his former client, Balram Prasad Sharma (representing Madhya Pradesh State Co-operative Bank Ltd.), after his retainership was terminated. The advocate claimed a lien on the files for unpaid legal fees, while the bank disputed the outstanding amount and sought the return of the files to continue pending legal proceedings. The core issue is whether an advocate has a lien on litigation papers for unpaid fees.","The court analyzed Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act regarding liens, concluding that litigation files do not qualify as 'goods' under this section because they lack marketability and cannot be sold. The court also considered the Bar Council of India Rules, which allow advocates to deduct fees from client money but do not grant a lien on litigation files. The court emphasized the importance of a litigant's freedom to change advocates and the potential for abuse if advocates could withhold files for unpaid fees.",Not available in document

The dispute involves deficiency in service, specifically regarding the delivery of goods by the courier company. The main grievance arises from issues related to the quality of service and potential exploitation of consumers.","The court analyzed the Consumer Protection Act and found no provision authorizing Consumer Commissions to refer disputes for consensual adjudication. The court held that even with an arbitration clause, the Consumer Protection Act provides an additional remedy. The court clarified that while Commissions have powers similar to a court, the final adjudication must be by the Commission itself, and delegating this to a third party is an unhealthy practice.","The court set aside the final orders of the Commission and remitted the matters back, directing the Commission to allow parties to file objections to the award within a specified time and then consider the submissions before giving a decision. The appeals were disposed of with this direction."

L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J The Tata Iron & Steel Company Ltd. (TISCO, for short),
the appellant before us, has imported certain equipments and drawings and engineering documents
from Siderugia National of Portugal - a Government of Portugal Undertaking. It appears that some
time in the year 1981 Italimpianti, Genevo, Italy supplied materials, designs and engineering
drawings etc. to Siderugia National Portugal (hereinafter SNP, for short) for setting up rolling mill
project in Portugal. The supplies consisted of equipments for blast furnace, LD converter, steel plant
bellet castors, wire rod mills, torpedo ladle cars etc.. However, before the equipments could be
installed, Portugal decided to join European Economic Community (EEC) consequent whereupon
Portugal could not have expanded","Tata Iron & Steel Company Ltd. (TISCO) imported equipment and technical documents from Siderugia National of Portugal (SNP). The dispute concerns the valuation of these imported goods for the purpose of levying customs duty, specifically whether the value of the technical documents should be included in the value of the equipment. The Commissioner of Customs assessed a higher duty, which TISCO challenged.","The Tribunal applied Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) and Rule 9(1)(e) of the Customs Valuation Rules, 1988, holding that the value of technical documents should be included in the valuation of the imported equipment because they were compulsorily purchased together and separate values were not shown. The Supreme Court found that the Tribunal's interpretation of these rules was incorrect. Section 12 and 14 of the Customs Act were also relevant.","The Supreme Court set aside the Tribunal's order and remanded the case for reassessment of the value of the goods and determination of the customs duty and penalty, if any."

(1) Despite the decisions of this Court in Builders Association of India and others
vs.Union of India and others (1989) 2 SCC 645 and M/s. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.
and others vs. State of Rajasthan and others (1993) 1 SCC 364, the controversy as regards the power
of the State legislature to levy sales tax under clause (29A)(d) of Article 366 of the Constitution in
the context of the question where is the taxable event on the transfer of right to use any goods
remained unresolved. In this group of cases, we are concerned with the power of States legislatures
to levy sales tax on the transfer of right to use any goods envisaged under clause (29A)(d) of Article
366 of the Constitution on the premise that goods put to use are located within their States. Several
States by their legislations have levied tax on the transactions of transfer of right to use goods on the
location of goods at the time of their use within their States irrespective of the place where the
agreement for such transfer of the rig","Twentieth Century Finance Corpn. Ltd. and others challenged the power of State legislatures to levy sales tax on the transfer of the right to use goods under Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution. The appellants, leasing companies, argued that multiple states were taxing the same transaction based on the location of goods, contract execution, or delivery, leading to double taxation. They contested the validity of state legislations that taxed the transfer of the right to use goods by more than one state.","The case revolves around the interpretation of Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution and the power of states to levy sales tax on the transfer of the right to use goods. The court considered previous decisions in *Builders Association of India v. Union of India* and *Gannon Dunkerley & Co. v. State of Rajasthan*. The central question was determining the situs of the taxable event for such transactions, specifically whether the mere location of goods within a state at the time of use is sufficient to justify the levy of sales tax.",Not available in document

1. This appeal is directed against the order dated 21st June, 1996 of the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (National Commission) holding that
there was no negligence on the part of the respondent-bank in dealing with its
security of pledged shares of the appellant or its release in part to him and that the
bank could also not be faulted on its practice not to dispose of shares through brokers
not on the approved list of the bank and lastly that it could not be said that there was
any deficiency in service by the bank as defined in section 2(1)(g) of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 ('Act' for short). Leave was granted limited ","Vimal Chandra Grover obtained an overdraft facility from Bank of India against pledged shares, including Castrol Ltd. shares. The dispute arose when the bank delayed the sale of 500 Castrol Ltd. shares as requested by Grover, leading to a drop in their value and a financial loss for Grover. Grover alleged deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(g) (definition of 'deficiency') and Section 2(1)(o) (definition of 'service') of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to determine if the bank's actions constituted a deficiency in service. The court also considered whether Grover qualified as a 'consumer' under Section 2(d)(ii) of the Act. The court determined that providing overdraft facilities and agreeing to sell pledged shares constituted a service for consideration, and Grover was a consumer.",Not available in document

This appeal, by special leave, raises an interesting question :
whether a suit simpliciter for specific performance of contract for sale of immovable
property is a ""suit for land"" within clause 12 of Letters Patent of the High Court of
Judicature at Bombay?
The appellant is the defendant and the respondents are the plaintiffs in the suit out of
which this appeal arises. In this judgment the parties will be referred to as they are
arrayed in the trial court. The facts lie in a narrow campus and are not in dispute. By
an agreement of July 12, 1986 land together building known as ""Vithal Bhavan"",
bearing No.6/5 (Block No.24), South Tukoganj, Indore, M.P., (for short, 'the suit
property') was agreed to be sold by the defendant to the plaintiffs for a consideration
of Rs.53,75,000/-. Subsequently the parties executed a memorandum also in regard
to the suit property on August 1, 1987. Disputes arose between the parties with regard
to the performance of the said agreement. The plaintiffs filed Suit No.1088 of 1989 in

The defendant challenged the High Court's jurisdiction, arguing the suit is a ""suit for land"" requiring the land to be within the court's jurisdiction.","The court analyzed Clause 12 of the Letters Patent of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, which defines the court's original jurisdiction regarding suits for land. The court reviewed precedents, including M/s.Moolji Jaitha and Co. Vs. The Khandesh Spinning and Weaving Mills Co.

The appellant herein and his wife Smt. Alka Bose, took out a mediclaim insurance

result the appellant approached the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum

Indian Kanoon ","Biman Krishna Bose, the appellant, had a mediclaim policy with United India Insurance Co. Ltd. The insurance company refused to renew his policy after he pursued legal action to claim Rs. 8,243 for his wife's medical treatment. The appellant challenged this refusal, arguing it was unfair and would disadvantage him due to pre-existing condition clauses in future policies.","The court analyzed the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, specifically Sections 9, 24, and 3(a), determining that the respondent insurance company, as an acquiring company under the Act, had a monopoly and thus the trappings of the State under Article 12 of the Constitution. As such, the insurance company was obligated to act fairly and reasonably, and its refusal to renew the policy based on the appellant's past litigation was deemed arbitrary and a violation of these principles. The court also considered the implications of the exclusion clause regarding pre-existing conditions in fresh policies.","The appeal was allowed, and the High Court's order directing the appellant to take a fresh mediclaim policy was set aside. The court directed the insurance company to renew the appellant's mediclaim policy with effect from the date it fell due for renewal, provided the appellant applied for renewal and paid the premium."

Cadila Healthcare claimed that the similarity would cause confusion, especially since the drugs were medicines of last resort. The suit was filed in the District Court at Vadodara.","The judgment discusses the principles of infringement and passing off actions, particularly in the context of medicinal products, referencing Sections 27 and 28 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. It cites precedents such as National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. vs. James Chadwick and Bros Ltd., Corn Products Refining Company vs. Shangrila Food Products Limited, and Amritdhara Pharmacy vs. Satya Deo to establish the criteria for determining likelihood of deception or confusion in trade mark cases. The court emphasizes the importance of considering how an average consumer of ordinary intelligence would react to the trade marks.","The Supreme Court did not interfere with the orders passed by the lower courts, which had denied the interim injunction, but directed for expeditious disposal of the suit. The court refrained from expressing an opinion on the merits of the case at that stage."

1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants are running a non-banking financial institution, by name, Messrs Deluxe Leasing
Private Limited. The respondent, Sudhir Mehra, partner of a partnership firm, entered into a hire
purchase agreement with the appellants on 3.5.1994 whereunder a motor vehicle was","Charanjit Singh Chadha and others, running a non-banking financial institution (Deluxe Leasing Private Limited), appealed against Sudhir Mehra, a partner of a firm, regarding a hire purchase agreement for a motor vehicle. Mehra filed a criminal complaint alleging that the appellants forcibly took away the vehicle after he entrusted it to a mechanic for repairs, accusing them of offences under IPC sections 406/420/120-B. The core dispute revolves around the repossession of the vehicle due to alleged default in payment of installments.","The court analyzed the nature of hire purchase agreements, emphasizing that they are executory contracts with an option to purchase upon fulfilling the agreement's terms. The court referred to precedents like *M/s Damodar Valley Corporation vs. State of Bihar* and *K.L. Johar & Co. vs. The Deputy Commercial Tax Officer*, highlighting the dual elements of bailment and eventual sale in such agreements. The court also considered Section 378 IPC (theft) and Section 24 IPC (dishonestly), concluding that repossession under a valid hire purchase agreement, even if forceful, lacks the 'dishonest intention' necessary to constitute theft.","The appeal was allowed, and the proceedings against the appellants were quashed, as the court found that the allegations in the complaint did not constitute a criminal offense given the terms of the hire purchase agreement."

The plaintiff, feeling aggrieved by the orders of the learned Trial Judge and the High Court of
Gujarat, refusing his prayer for the grant of ad-interim injunction has filed these special leave
petitions.
Leave granted.
According to","Laxmikant V. Patel, the plaintiff, filed a suit against Chetanbhat Shah, the defendant, for passing off their business by using a similar name, 'Muktajivan Colour Lab and Studio'. The plaintiff claimed to have established goodwill and reputation under the name 'Muktajivan Colour Lab and Studio' since 1982. The plaintiff sought a permanent preventive injunction to restrain the defendants from using the name.","The court considered the principles of passing off, emphasizing that a business name with established goodwill is a property right protected by courts. The court referred to the Trade Marks Act, 1999, defining 'trade mark' and 'mark' to include names and words. The court also cited Salmond & Heuston's Law of Torts and Oertli Vs. Bowman to explain the elements of a passing off action, including reputation, deception, and likelihood of damages.",Not available in document

The core issue revolves around whether an arbitrator can be considered a 'Court' for the purposes of Section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) and Section 195 Cr.P.C. The specific product or service and the main grievance are not explicitly detailed in the provided text.,"The court analyzes Sections 340 and 195 of the Cr.P.C., particularly focusing on the definition of 'Court' in Section 195(3). It examines whether an arbitrator falls within the definition of 'Court' as a tribunal constituted by an Act and declared by that Act to be a Court for the purposes of Section 195. The court also considers precedents like Thawardass Pherumal & Anr. v. Union of India (AIR 1955 SC 468) and Brajnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain (AIR 1956 SC 66) to determine the characteristics of a 'Court'.","The provided document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome or decision of the court.

The insurance policy was issued after Malhotra paid with a cheque that was later dishonored due to insufficient funds. The dispute centers on whether the insurance company is liable when the premium cheque bounces, despite having issued a cover note.","The court analyzed Section 64-VB of the Insurance Act, which states that an insurer is not liable unless the premium is received. It also referred to Sections 51, 52, and 54 of the Indian Contract Act regarding reciprocal promises, arguing that the insured's promise to pay via cheque was not fulfilled when the cheque bounced. The court cited Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Inderjit Kaur (1998 (1) SCC 371) and New India Assurance Co.

Leave granted This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court of
Allahabad dismissing a writ petition filed by the appellant. Certain disciplinary
proceedings were initiated against the appellant. After inquiry, he was held guilty of
the charges and was ultimately terminated from service. A writ petition was filed by
him in the High Court on the grounds, inter alia, that:

2. The findings recorded in the inquiry are based on conjectures and surmis","P.C. Joshi, a judicial officer, was terminated from service following disciplinary proceedings based on complaints from advocates regarding bail orders he granted. The charges included granting bail improperly and other administrative actions. The appellant filed a writ petition challenging his termination, which was dismissed by the High Court.","The court referenced precedents like Union of India & Ors. vs. A.N.Saxena and Union of India & Anr. vs. K.K.Dhawan, and Ishwar Chand Jain vs. High Court of Punjab & Haryana & Anr., emphasizing that disciplinary action against judicial officers should not be initiated merely because an order is deemed faulty. The court stated that there should be evidence of mala fide intent, corruption, or recklessness, not just a difference of opinion on the merits of a case. The court found no such evidence in this case.","The appeal was allowed, the High Court's order was set aside, and the appellant was directed to be reinstated in service with continuity of service and all consequential benefits."

Smita Conductors Ltd vs Euro Alloys Lt","Smita Conductors Ltd. and Euro Alloys Ltd. entered into a contract dispute regarding the supply of aluminum rods. Euro Alloys claimed Smita Conductors breached the contract due to restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on import of goods, leading to arbitration proceedings in London. Smita Conductors challenged the validity of the arbitration agreement and the subsequent award.","The core legal issue revolved around whether a valid arbitration agreement existed in writing as required by Section 2(a) of the Foreign Awards (Recognition & Enforcement) Act, 1961, and Article II of the New York Convention. The appellant argued that since the contract containing the arbitration clause was not signed by them, there was no agreement in writing. The respondent contended that the correspondence and conduct of the appellant established the existence of an arbitration agreement.",Not available in document

taking measures conductive to the development and management of the electricity industry in an

January, 1999, it came into ","The Association of Industrial Electricity Users appealed against the State of Andhra Pradesh and others regarding the tariff fixed by the Regulatory Commission for the period April 1, 2000, to March 31, 2001. The Association challenged the tariff, arguing that it violated Section 26 of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1998, by showing undue preference to domestic consumers over industrial consumers.","The court analyzed Section 26 of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1998, particularly sub-sections (5) and (9), to determine the procedure for tariff fixation and amendment. The court interpreted sub-section (9) as applying only to tariff amendments during a financial year, while sub-section (5) governs the annual tariff fixation exercise. The court also clarified that while undue preference to any consumer is prohibited, differentiation based on factors like load factor, consumption, and paying capacity is permissible under Section 26(7).","Although the tariff period in question had expired rendering the appeals infructuous, the court addressed the interpretation of Section 26 for future guidance. The specific outcome regarding the appeal (allowed/dismissed) is not explicitly stated, but given the infructuous nature, no effective relief was granted."

The complaint alleged medical negligence in the treatment of Chaturvedi's son at Breach Candy Hospital, leading to his death after a slip disc operation. The doctors argued that the case involved complicated questions of law and fact best decided by a civil court or stayed due to a pending criminal prosecution.","The court considered whether delay in disposal by consumer forums or the complexity of facts warrants directing the complainant to civil court. It cited Indian Medical Association v. V.P. Shantha, clarifying that while complex cases may be referred to civil court, the Consumer Protection Act provides an alternative, efficacious, simple, inexpensive, and speedy remedy. The court emphasized that the Act's summary procedure, with safeguards for natural justice, is sufficient for resolving consumer disputes, even those involving expert negligence.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's decision to proceed with the consumer complaint."

The Central Excise department argued that since Escorts JCB arranged transit insurance, the sale wasn't complete until delivery, implying the insurance cost should be included in the assessable value. The product involved is Excavators Loaders.",The court analyzed Section 4 of the Central Excise Act 1944 regarding the valuation of excisable goods and Section 39 of the Sale of Goods Act regarding delivery to a carrier. The court determined that arranging transit insurance by the seller doesn't necessarily mean the ownership of goods is retained until delivery. The court cited various legal texts and precedents to support the view that insurance can be taken by a third party on behalf of another and that the passing of property is rarely relevant to insurance.,Not available in document

This appeal is against the judgment dated 7th February, 2000. Briefly stated the facts are as follows:
The Appellant appeared for M.A. Examination in Islamic History and Culture held by
the Calcutta University in November, 1984. The result of the examination was
announced on 6th June, 1985. However the result of the Appellant was not declared.
The Appellant then took admission in the Law Course. On 9th December, 1990, the
Appellant wrote to the Controller of Examinations and requested that his result, of
the examination h","Rabindra Nath Ghosal, the appellant, appeared for an M.A. examination conducted by the University of Calcutta, but his result was not declared for several years. He filed a writ petition seeking declaration of his result, which was eventually declared as a failure. The dispute arose over the delay in declaring the result and whether the University should be liable for compensation due to negligence.","The court considered whether the delay in declaring the result warranted compensation under public law principles, citing precedents like *Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta* and *Common Cause versus Union of India*. It emphasized that compensation under public law is typically awarded for infringement of fundamental rights, particularly Article 21, due to arbitrary or capricious actions by public functionaries. The court distinguished this case from those involving personal injury, custodial deaths, or medical negligence, finding no evidence that the appellant's fundamental rights were violated or that he suffered significant prejudice.","The appeal was dismissed, and the High Court's judgment setting aside the award of damages to the appellant was upheld, as the court found no grounds for compensation under public law despite the University's negligence."

The High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad has, by its impugned judgment dated April 11,
1990, allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd.
(hereinafter 'NTPCL', for short) and declared that the levy of duty by the State of Andhra Pradesh on
the sales of electrical energy generated by the Corporation-respondent No.1 at its thermal power
station set up at Ramagundam, within the State of Andhra Pradesh, and sold to the Electricity
Boards of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the State of Goa in pursuance of contracts of sales
occasioning inter-State movement of electricity is incompetent and outside the power of State
Legislature. Consequently, the tax levied and collected has also been held to be wi","The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed a High Court decision that favored National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPCL). The dispute concerned the levy of duty by the State of Andhra Pradesh on sales of electrical energy generated by NTPCL within the state and sold to Electricity Boards of other states and Goa, with the state claiming it was an intra-state sale and thus taxable.","The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Duty Act, 1939, provides for a levy on certain sales and consumption of electricity by licensees, including NTPCL. The central issue was whether the sales of electricity by NTPCL to Electricity Boards outside Andhra Pradesh constituted inter-state or intra-state sales, impacting the state's power to levy duty. The court also considered the M.P. Electricity Duty Act, 1949 and the M.P. Upkar Adhiniyam 1981 in a related transfer case.",Not available in document

Synco Industries sought a direction for a funding package, waiver of interest, and damages. The National Commission dismissed the complaint, stating it was not a fit case to be tried under the Consumer Protection Act.","The Supreme Court did not explicitly cite specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act. However, the court reasoned that the case involved complex evidence to prove the claim and damages, making it unsuitable for summary disposal under the Consumer Protection Act. The court implied that the Consumer Forum was being used to avoid court fees associated with a civil suit.","The Civil Appeal was dismissed, with costs awarded in favor of the first respondent (State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur)."

Leave granted. Heard appellant in person and the learned counsel for the Respondent.
This appeal has been preferred against the order dated April 9, 2001 passed by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dismissing the revision filed by the appellant. The short
point in controversy is, as to whether or not the St","Topline Shoes Ltd. filed a complaint against Corporation Bank before the Gujarat State Consumer Redressal Commission, alleging failure to advance a loan despite security being furnished. The dispute centered on whether the State Commission could grant the bank time to file its reply beyond the 45-day limit stipulated in Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Topline Shoes argued that the bank's reply should be rejected as it was filed beyond the permissible time.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which prescribes a 30-day period for the opposite party to give their version, extendable by a maximum of 15 days. The Court held that while the provision aims for speedy redressal, it is directory rather than mandatory, as no penal consequences are prescribed for exceeding the 45-day limit. The Court cited precedents like Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal Kotah and Anr. (AIR 1955 S.C. 425) to support the interpretation of procedural laws facilitating justice.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order. The court found that exceeding the 15-day extension period for filing a reply does not cause a fatal illegality, and the Forum/Commission has the discretion to consider the reply even if filed beyond 45 days."

1. Leave granted in SLP (SIC) No. CC 6293/02 & SLP (SIC) No. CC 6307/02. In the connected
appeals, leave has already been granted. All these matters raised common question of law and facts,
hence, have been clubbed together.
2. The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (the Commission) by an order dated
7.11.2001 determined the tariff for the sale of electricity by the Calcutta Electricity Supply Company
Ltd. (the Company) for the year 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Being aggrieved by the said
determination of tariff, the Company preferred an appeal before the High Court of Calcutta under
Section 27 of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, (the 1998 Act). The High Court by the
impugned judgment has allowed the appeal of the Company by itself re-determining the tariff and
enhancing the same. It is against this judgment of the High Court the above civil appeals","The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Calcutta Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (CESC) are in dispute over the tariff determined by the Commission for the sale of electricity. CESC appealed to the High Court of Calcutta, which re-determined the tariff and enhanced it, leading to appeals by the Commission and other aggrieved parties. The core issue revolves around the appropriate tariff for electricity and the validity of the regulatory commission's procedures.","The judgment primarily focuses on interpreting the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998, specifically Section 29 regarding tariff determination. It also references the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. The court analyzes the powers and functions of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission and the methodology it should follow in determining tariffs, emphasizing transparency and consumer interests. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is mentioned in Section 49, giving it overriding effect.",The final outcome of the appeals is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt. The court reserves the question of bias for later consideration and focuses on the broader legal issues related to tariff determination.

This appeal and the connected special leave petition arise out of the same execution proceedings and
the impugned order dated 23.4.2001 passed by the High Court of Patna.
The principle question involved is whether a purchaser of a vacant land under registered Sale Deed
and claiming to be in possession of the land can maintain an application under Order 21 Rule 97 of
the Code of Civi","Ashan Devi & Anr (Objectors) claimed dispossession from land they purchased via registered sale deeds, due to an ex-parte decree of specific performance obtained by Phulwasi Devi & Ors (Decree Holder) against the original owner (Judgment Debtor). The Objectors were not party to the specific performance suit. The dispute centered on whether the Objectors could maintain an application under Order 21 Rule 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure, complaining of dispossession.","The court analyzed Order XXI Rules 99 and 101 of the Code of Civil Procedure, focusing on amendments introduced by Act No. 104 of 1976, which aimed to shorten litigation by allowing executing courts to determine third-party claims. The court cited precedents like Brahmdeo Chaudhary vs. Rishikesh Prasad Jaiswal & Anr. and Shreenath & Anr. vs. Rajesh & Ors. to support the interpretation that the executing court has the power to adjudicate the rights and titles of the parties involved in the execution proceedings, preventing the need for separate suits.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the High Court's judgment and restoring the executing court's order which directed restoration of possession to the Objectors. The court held that the Objectors' application under Order XXI Rule 99 of the Code was maintainable."

PATIL, J. Respondent nos. 6-19 (in writ petition before the High Court) were engaged as
Garndeners (Malis) to sweep, clean and maintain and look after the lawns and parks inside the
factory premises and the campus of the residential colony of the appellant through the agency of
respondent nos. 3-5. Their services were terminated on 1.12.1988. They raised industrial disputes
before the Labour Court. The appellant took up a plea that they were never ","Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd (BHEL) appealed against a High Court order that upheld a Labour Court award. The dispute concerned the termination of services of gardeners (Malis) who claimed to be employees of BHEL, while BHEL argued they were employed through a contractor. The gardeners sought re-employment and compensation for non-compliance with the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.","The court considered whether the gardeners were employees of BHEL or the contractor, focusing on the degree of control BHEL exercised over their work. The court cited Hussainbhai Calicut v. The Alath Factory Thizolali Union Kozhikode and Ors., emphasizing that if the work is for the business of another, that other is the employer, regardless of intermediate contractors. The court also referred to Steel Authority of India Ltd and Ors. v. National Union Waterfront Workers and Ors., clarifying that the determination depends on the facts and circumstances of the case, and the Hussainbhai Calicut case was not dissented from.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the High Court's order which concurred with the Labour Court's finding that the gardeners were employees of BHEL."

The complainant claimed the bank wrongly debited Rs. 75,70,352 from their account by honoring forged cheques and altered figures. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) returned the complaint, citing the complexity of the case and the time required for its resolution.","The Supreme Court considered Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and cited precedents like *Dr. J.J Merchant & Ors. v.

The Court emphasized that consumer forums are meant for summary and speedy remedies and should not deny a hearing merely due to the complexity of facts or law, as long as the matter can be determined by summary inquiry. The Court stated that the NCDRC should have taken pleadings from both parties before deciding on the nature and scope of the enquiry.","The appeal was allowed, and the impugned decision of the National Commission was set aside.

1992 and Civi","The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) appealed against a High Court judgment directing the transfer of a plot to Mrs. Vijaya C. Gurshaney based on a Letter of Administration granted to her following a will from the original allottee, Ram Dhan. DDA sought to levy 50% of the unearned increase in the value of the property, arguing that the transfer was effectively a sale to a non-blood relative, violating the lease deed's terms. The dispute centers on whether the DDA can inquire into the nature of the transaction behind the will and demand the unearned increase.","The Supreme Court found that the High Court erred by not considering the terms of the perpetual lease deed and DDA's policy regarding unearned increases on property transfers to non-blood relatives via wills. The court emphasized that granting Letters of Administration doesn't confer title and that DDA, under the Delhi Development Act, has the power to manage and dispose of land according to its policies. The court stated that DDA can inquire into whether a will is actually a sale disguised as such, disregarding the policy.","The appeals were allowed, and the High Court's judgment was set aside, allowing DDA to inquire into the nature of the transaction."

The appellant in this appeal i","Jitendra Kumar's Maruti Van, insured with Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., was damaged by fire due to a mechanical fault. The Insurance Company repudiated the claim because the driver allegedly did not have a valid license, leading to a dispute over the insurance claim. The appellant challenged the decision of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which upheld the Insurance Company's repudiation.","The court analyzed Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, stating it doesn't allow repudiation of a claim when the driver's lack of a valid license didn't contribute to the accident. The court distinguished the case from New India Assurance Company Ltd., Shimla vs. Kamla & Ors., clarifying that a fake license doesn't automatically justify claim repudiation if the driver's actions weren't the cause of the damage. The court interpreted that the Insurance Company cannot repudiate a claim if the accident occurred due to reasons other than the act of the driver.","The appeal was allowed, the judgments of the National Commission and the State Commission were set aside, and the order of the District Forum, which had initially favored the appellant, was restored."

THE BACKGROUND FACT:
The appellant (Club) herein is an association incorporated under the laws of the
United Kingdom. It is a mutual association of ship owners. It offers insurance cover
in respect of the vessels entered with it for diverse third party risks associated with
the operation and trading of vessels. According to the appellant, no vessel operates
without a Protection & Indemnity (P&I) cover and the same has been made
compulsory to allow a ship to enter major ports in India.
'Sea Ranger' and 'Sea Glory' are the sister vessels of the 1st respondent vessel and
they are allegedly owned by the 2nd respondent. The first two vessels entered into a
contract with the appellant's association for the years 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 but
they have not paid the unpaid insurance premium due and payable by the 2nd
respondent for various P&I risks for which they had been insured. These unpaid
insurance calls being ""necessaries"" was enforceable within the ""admiralty
jurisdiction"" of the Bombay High Court.
For the arrest of the 1st respondent vesse","Liverpool & London S.P. & I Asson. Ltd., a ship owners' association providing insurance cover, filed a suit against M.V. Sea Success I and its alleged owner for unpaid insurance premiums for sister vessels. The association sought the arrest of the vessel to secure the claim for the unpaid premium, arguing it constituted a 'necessary' under admiralty law. The core dispute revolves around whether unpaid insurance premiums qualify as 'necessaries' under Section 5 of the Admiralty Courts Act, 1861, allowing for the arrest of the vessel.","The case primarily analyzes Section 5 of the Admiralty Courts Act, 1861, concerning claims for 'necessaries' supplied to a ship. The court considered arguments and precedents from various jurisdictions, including the UK, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, and the US, regarding the interpretation of 'necessaries' and whether it encompasses unpaid insurance premiums. The arguments centered on whether insurance is a direct and proximate necessity for the operation of the ship, similar to goods or services essential for a voyage.",Not available in document

Defendant No. 3 is the appellant herein. Defendant No. 1 is admittedly the owner of
the property in suit. Defendant No. 2 is the constituted attorney of Defendant No. 1,
who, on or about 1.10.1978 is said to have entered into an agreement for sale with the
Plaintiff in respect of the suit property bearing No. C.T.S. No. 1921/A of Gadag
Betageri City Municipal area for a total consideration of Rs. 30,000/- out of which a
sum of Rs. 20,000/- was allegedly paid as advance. In terms of the said agreement,
the plaintiff allegedly was put in possession of the suit property.
The Deed of sale, pursuant to the said agreement was to be executed within 3 years
from the date thereof on payment of the balance sum of Rs. 10,000/-. Defendant No.
3, the appellant herein, purchased the suit property by reason of a registered deed of
sale dated 15.5.1984 for valuable consideration of Rs. 50,000/-. The plaintiff on or
about 15.5.1984 admittedly made an enquiry in the C.T.S. Office to obtain the C.T.S.

The plaintiff sued for specific performance after the original owner (Defendant No. 1) sold the property to another party (Defendant No. 3/Appellant). The plaintiff claimed to have an earlier agreement for sale with Defendant No. 1 through her attorney (Defendant No. 2) and alleged payment of an advance.,"The court analyzed Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which mandates that a plaintiff seeking specific performance must aver and prove readiness and willingness to perform their part of the contract. The court found that the plaintiff failed to make such averments in the plaint and did not demonstrate readiness and willingness within the stipulated timeframe. Several precedents, including Ouseph Varghese vs. Joseph Aley & Ors. and Syed Dastagir vs. T.R. Gopalakrishna Setty, were cited to support the interpretation of Section 16(c).","The appeal was allowed, and the High Court's judgment was set aside, effectively dismissing the plaintiff's suit for specific performance."

The constitutional validity of the amendment to the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Adhiniyam 1981 (the
1981 Adhiniyam) is the subject matter of challenge in these matters. The amendment was initially
made by an ordinance promulgated on 29th June 2001 by the State Government and entitled the
""Madhya Pradesh Upkar (Sanshodhan) Adhyadesh, 2001""
(hereafter referred to as the 'Ordinance'). By the amendment, a cess @ 20 paise per
unit was imposed on the captive power producer on the total units of electrical energy
produced. The Act which has subsequently replaced the Ordinance is known as the
Madhya Pradesh Upkar (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as
M.P. Cement Manufacturers' ... vs State Of Madhy","The M.P. Cement Manufacturers' Association challenged the constitutional validity of an amendment to the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Adhiniyam, 1981, which imposed a cess on captive power producers based on the total units of electrical energy produced. The association argued that the state legislature lacked the competence to levy a tax on the production of electricity, as it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament, and also alleged violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.","The court analyzed Entry 84 of List-I and Entry 53 of List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, determining that the Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction over excise duty on the production of electricity, while the State can tax the sale and consumption of electricity. The court interpreted the amended Section 3(2) of the Upkar Adhiniyam as levying a cess on the 'electrical energy produced,' regardless of its destination (sale, supply, or consumption), indicating a tax on generation rather than sale or consumption.",Not available in document

1.1 These appeals by special leave preferred by the Union of India are directed against the common
judgment of the Bombay High Court in a batch of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the
Constitution by the manufacturers/importers of certain bulk drugs and their formulations. The bulk
drugs concerned are seven in number. They are: Salbutamol, Theophylline, Cyproflaxacin,
Norfloxacin, Cloxacillin, Doxycycline and Glipizide. These bulk drugs and the formulations made
out of them are sold within the country and part of the quantities produced are also exported
outside the count","The Secretary, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India, appealed against a judgment by the Bombay High Court in favor of M/s. Cipla Ltd. & Ors, manufacturers/importers of certain bulk drugs. The dispute concerned the inclusion of seven bulk drugs (Salbutamol, Theophylline, Cyproflaxacin, Norfloxacin, Cloxacillin, Doxycycline and Glipizide) in the first schedule to the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 (DPCO), which allowed the government to control their prices. The manufacturers challenged this inclusion, arguing it violated the norms laid down in the Drug Policy of 1994.","The court analyzed the Drug Policy of 1994, particularly paragraph 22.7.2, which sets out criteria for including drugs under price control based on turnover and market competition. The court held that while policy documents are not statutory provisions, the government, acting as both policy-maker and delegate of legislative power, must substantially conform to its own policy guidelines when selecting drugs for price control. Deviations from the self-evolved criteria without demonstrable justification can lead to arbitrariness and violate Article 14 of the Constitution, as cited in Indian Express Newspapers Vs. Union of India.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome of the appeal. Therefore, the final decision is Not available in document."

The respondents, being the members of the appellant-society, had pledged paddy bags for obtaining
loan. The appellant-society issued notices to the respondents demanding payment of loan amount
with interest thereon. The respondents filed petitions in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum, Thiruchirapally seeking direction to the appellant to release the paddy bags pl","Members of the Thirumurugan Co-operative Agricultural Credit Society (respondents) pledged paddy bags to obtain loans from the society (appellant). When the society demanded repayment with interest, the respondents filed complaints with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, seeking the release of their pledged paddy or compensation for its market value, alleging deficiency in service and mental agony.","The appellant argued that Section 90 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983, and Section 156 barred the Consumer Forum's jurisdiction. The court considered Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which states that its provisions are in addition to, and not in derogation of, other laws. The court also examined the objects and reasons behind the Consumer Protection Act, emphasizing its purpose to provide better protection and redressal mechanisms for consumers.","The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission allowed the revision petition, setting aside the State Commission's order and restoring the District Forum's order, implying that the consumer forum did have jurisdiction."

JUDGMENT:
JUDGMENT 2003(1) SCR 397 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.B. SINHA, J. The
primal question involved in this batch of appeals and the Writ Petitions is the constitutionality of
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter called ""","The State of Karnataka appealed a Karnataka High Court judgment upholding the constitutionality of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Vishwabharathi House Building Cooperative Society was a respondent. The core issue was whether the Parliament had the power to establish consumer courts parallel to the existing judicial system.","The court analyzed the legislative competence of the Parliament under the Constitution of India, specifically referencing Item 11A of List III of the Seventh Schedule, which grants power to make laws regarding the constitution and organization of all courts except the Supreme Court and High Courts. The court held that the Consumer Protection Act is in addition to, and not in derogation of, other existing laws, as stated in Section 3 of the Act. The court also considered the object and purpose of the Act, which is to provide better protection for consumers.","The appeal filed by the State of Karnataka questioned certain observations made in the High Court regarding the interpretation of Section 25 of the Act. The document does not explicitly state the final outcome of the appeal, but it implies that the High Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of the Act was likely affirmed."

3. These appeals are by the State of Uttaranchal assailing the common judgment and order dated

4. Resolution of the dispute in these appeals depends on the answer to the question whether the

Uttaranchal, is binding on the State of Uttaranchal so as to appoint selected candidates to the
services in the State of Uttaranchal having due regard to Article 323(2) of the Constitution of India

The arguments revolved around whether the UPPSC's recommendations were binding on Uttaranchal, given the state's new reservation policy and the interpretation of the Act regarding the laying of the UPPSC report before the Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly.

The dispute centered on whether the rentals collected by DoT from telephone subscribers for the 'transfer of right to use' the telephone system were taxable under the Uttar Pradesh Trade Tax Act, 1948. The State argued that the DoT was a 'dealer' and the activity constituted a 'sale' under the extended definition in Article 366(29-A) of the Constitution.","The court analyzed Section 3 and 3-F of the U.P. Act, along with the definitions of 'business', 'dealer', 'goods', and 'sale' in Section 2. It considered whether the DoT qualified as a 'dealer' and whether providing telephone service constituted a 'transfer of the right to use any goods'.

BACKGROUND FACTS:
Andhra Bank (Respondent No. 3) is a nationalized bank. Andhra Bank Financial
Services Limited (Respondent No. 4) is a company wholly owned by Andhra Bank.
Canbank Mutual Fund (CBMF) is a subsidiary company of Canara Bank, another
nationalized bank. The Appellant herein is also a subsidiary of Canara Bank. In or
about 1989, Canbank Mutual Fund floated an open ended investment scheme known
as CANCIGO on an assured return of 12.5% p.a. payable half yearly; the lock in period
wherefor was one year. A stipulation was also made to the effect that transfers are not
pe","Canbank Financial Services Ltd. appealed against the Special Court's decision regarding the ownership of CANCIGO certificates. Hiten P. Dalal, a notified person under the Special Courts Act, used funds from Andhra Bank and Andhra Bank Financial Services to purchase CANCIGO units, later offering them to Canbank Financial Services to discharge his liabilities. The dispute centered on whether Canbank Financial Services could claim ownership of the CANCIGOs given restrictions on transfer and the implications of the Special Courts Act.","The Special Court analyzed Section 3 of the Special Court Act regarding attachment of property belonging to a notified person, and Section 4(2) of the Benami Transactions Act. It also considered the applicability of Section 58 of the Trusts Act. The court relied on V.B. Rangaraj Vs. V.B. Gopalakrishnan & Ors. to support the proposition that transfers contrary to the terms of issue are invalid. The court interpreted that the restrictions on transfer of CANCIGOs prevented Canbank Financial Services from acquiring valid ownership, and the Custodian's claim under the Special Courts Act prevailed.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Special Court's decision. Canbank Financial Services was directed to hand over the CANCIGO certificates to the Custodian, and its monetary claim against Respondent No. 2 would be considered during asset distribution."

Colour Chem Ltd. is a target company. Its shares are listed on the Bombay Stock
Exchange and National Stock Exchange. Appellant No.1 (Clariant) in Civil Appeal
No.3183 o","Clariant International Ltd. was directed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to make a public announcement and pay interest to shareholders of Colour Chem Ltd. due to a delayed open offer. The dispute centered around the rate of interest, whether dividends should be set off against the interest, and which shareholders were eligible for the interest payment.","The case involved interpreting Regulation 44 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, along with Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992. The court considered arguments regarding the appropriate rate of interest to compensate shareholders for the delay and whether the interest should be paid only to those who held shares on the triggering date. Precedents regarding interest rates in other contexts were cited, but the court ultimately deferred to SEBI's expertise in setting the rate.","The appeals were related to the Securities Appellate Tribunal's judgment. The Tribunal's decision was upheld in part, with the Supreme Court addressing the eligibility of shareholders for interest payments; the rate of interest was maintained at 15%, and dividends were not required to be deducted from the interest payable."

matrix of these three appeals is a judgment rendered by the III Additional Metropolitan Session
Judge, Hyderabad acting as the Designated court under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
(Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short the 'TADA').
Nine persons were alleged to be responsible for homicidal death of one Joga Singh (hereinafter
referred to as the 'deceased'). Five of them faced trial and one of them Nishan Singh (A-3) died
during the trial and therefore the case abated so far he is concerned. The accused persons who faced
trial were Esher S","The case involves Esher Singh and other accused individuals who were charged with conspiring to kill Joga Singh, who managed several educational institutions for the Sikh community. The prosecution alleged that the accused aimed to take over these institutions and promote the Khalistan movement. The grievance stems from the alleged conspiracy and the subsequent death of Joga Singh.","The trial court found Esher Singh guilty under Section 4 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA). The judgment does not explicitly mention or apply any sections of the Consumer Protection Act. The appeals questioned the legality of the conviction and sentence, as well as the acquittal of other accused individuals.","Esher Singh's appeal questions the legality of his conviction and sentence under TADA, while the State of Andhra Pradesh and Balbir Singh (son of the deceased) appeal against the acquittal of the other accused. The final outcome of the appeals is not available in this truncated document."

The question raised in this appeal is whether the Special Court constituted under The Special Courts
(Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Act') has power to condone the delay in filing a petition under Section 4(2) of the Act.
The object of the Act as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons is to deal with the situation
created by large scale irregularities and malpractices in transactions in securities indulged in by
some brokers in collusion with the employees of various banks and financial institutions. In
particular, the Act seeks to ensure speedy recovery of the funds which have been diverted from
banks and financial institutions to the individual accounts of brokers. The other objectives of the Act
are to puni","Fairgrowth Investments Ltd. appealed against the Custodian's notification under Section 3(2) of The Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992, objecting to the notification attaching their properties. The Special Court rejected the application because it was filed beyond the 30-day limitation period prescribed by Section 4(2) of the Act. The core dispute is whether the Special Court has the power to condone the delay in filing the petition.","The court analyzed Section 4(2) of the Special Courts Act, determining that the 30-day limitation period for filing objections to notifications is mandatory and cannot be extended by the Special Court's inherent jurisdiction. The court distinguished precedents cited by the appellant and emphasized the unequivocal language of Section 4(2). The court also held that Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963, does not apply to the Special Courts Act in this context, reinforcing the mandatory nature of the limitation period.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Special Court's decision that it lacked the power to condone the delay in filing the petition under Section 4(2) of the Special Courts Act."

The main grievance was the uniform application of 18% interest without considering the specific facts of each case.","The Supreme Court considered whether the grant of 18% interest by Consumer Forums in all cases of deficiency of service by development authorities is justifiable. The Court referred to Lucknow Development Authority vs. M. K. Gupta, establishing that Development Authorities render service under the Consumer Protection Act. The Court emphasized that liability to pay interest arises from default or omission causing damage to the allottee, and the compensation should be determined based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.",The Court found that the National Commission was incorrectly granting/confirming interest at a uniform rate of 18% per annum without considering the specific facts of each case. The Court decided to examine each case separately after addressing the question of law.

Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development
Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18%
per annum irrespective of the fact of each case. This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad
Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice. This
Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts
of the case. This Court has held that the Consumer Forums coul","The Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) appealed against orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission granting 18% interest to complainants who were allotted plots long ago but not given possession despite paying all dues. The complainants were offered alternate plots at higher prices, which they refused, leading them to file complaints seeking alternate plots at the original price. The core issue revolves around deficiency in service by HUDA in failing to provide possession of allotted plots.","The Supreme Court referred to its earlier judgment in Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh, deprecating the practice of granting a uniform 18% interest in all cases. The Court emphasized that compensation for mental agony/harassment must be based on a finding of loss or injury and correlate with the amount of loss or injury, requiring a determination of deficiency in service or misfeasance in public office. The Court directed the Forum/Commission to follow the principles laid down in the Balbir Singh case in future cases.","The appeals were disposed of with modifications; the court directed HUDA to pay compensation at 12% from the date of deposit until the date of possession for mental agony/harassment and increased construction costs, and also imposed a 15% interest penalty for delayed payment following a previous court order, along with costs to be recovered from responsible officers."

The grievance was that the defects were not adequately rectified despite repeated attempts.","The judgment focuses on the failure of service by the manufacturer and dealer in providing a defect-free car. The court inferred the defect existed at the time of delivery based on the dealer's initial acknowledgement and willingness to repair. The court did not explicitly cite specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act, but impliedly applied principles related to defective goods and deficiency in service.","The appeal was allowed. The court directed the Respondents to pay for the repair of the car at a garage chosen by the Appellant, awarded Rs. 40,000 for mental agony, and directed the 1st Respondent to pay Rs. 50,000 as costs."

JUDGMENT 2004(3) SCR 629 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.C. LAHOTI, J. Leave
granted in SLP (C) No.9334 of 2000.
A common question of law centering around Sections 107 and 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872
arises for decision in these two appeals.
In Civil Appeal No. 2655 of 1999 Sham Prakash Sharma, the late husband of Mrs. Anuradha, the
respondent, had taken a life insurance policy from the appellant-Life Insurance Corporation of India
(hereinafter, the LIC or Corporation for short). The policy commenced with effect from 8.2.1986.
The premium was payable every six months. For two years, the premium was paid. On 17.7.1988
Sham Prakash Sharma was at Bombay wherefrom he just disappeared, never to be traced out
thereafter. The respondent, Anuradha, lodged a first information report with the police. On 11th
July, 1988, the LIC had sent a communication addressed to Sham Prakash Sharma and delivered at
his residence informing that the insurance policy had lapsed for nonpayment of premium. On
29.6.1996, the respondent approached the LIC for release of benefits under the policy proceeding on
an assumption that Sham Prakash was dead as having not been heard of for a period of more than
seven years.","The case involves a dispute between L.I.C. of India and Anuradha, the wife of Sham Prakash Sharma, who disappeared in 1988 after taking a life insurance policy. Anuradha claimed benefits under the policy after Sham Prakash was not heard of for seven years, but LIC denied the claim citing non-payment of premiums and a rule requiring a court decree or continued premium payments. The grievance is the denial of insurance benefits based on the policy terms and the presumption of death under the Evidence Act.","The court analyzed Sections 107 and 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, concerning the presumption of death after a person has not been heard of for seven years. The court referenced English Law and previous Indian cases, including *N. Jayalakshmi Ammal v. R. Gopala Pathar* and *Darshan Singh v. Gujjar Singh*, to clarify that while Section 108 shifts the burden of proving life, it does not establish the time of death. The court concluded that the presumption only establishes death at the time the question arises, not at the time of disappearance.","Although the LIC agreed to release the insurance amounts as an ex-gratia payment, the court proceeded to adjudicate the question of law. The court clarified the legal position regarding presumption of death under Sections 107 and 108 of the Indian Evidence Act."

of a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court, whereby the appeal preferred by respondent nos. 1 and 2

delivery of goods pursuant to the contracts mentioned in Annexure-A to the writ petition and also to
deliver the goods mentioned in A","National Textile Corpn. Ltd. appealed against a Calcutta High Court judgment regarding a writ petition filed by M/s Haribox Swalram & Ors. The dispute concerns the non-delivery of goods (cloth) by the National Textile Corporation after taking over Finlay Mills Limited and Gold Mohur Mills Limited, despite advance payments made by the respondents under pre-takeover contracts. The respondents sought a writ of mandamus to compel the delivery of the goods or a refund of their advance payments.","The document does not explicitly mention the application of the Consumer Protection Act or cite specific precedents. The core issue revolves around whether the National Textile Corporation was obligated to fulfill pre-takeover contracts and whether the writ petition was the appropriate legal avenue for seeking specific performance of those contracts. The court considered arguments regarding the validity of the contracts, the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, and the delay in filing the writ petition.",Not available in document

Versus Polymat India P. Ltd. & Anr.
A.K. MATHUR, J.
Both the appeals arise against the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi. One Civil Appeal No. 4366/1999 is filed by the Polymat India Pvt. Ltd. and
the other Civil Appeal No. 6063/1999 is filed by the National Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors.
against the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi on
27th May, 1999 in the Original Petition No. 204 of 1994.
Since both the appeals raise common question of law and arise out of the same order, they are
disposed of by the common order.
Brief facts of the case are as under:
That the Original Petition was filed by the Complainant M/s Polymat India Pvt. Ltd.
& Anr. as a consequence of its claim under 2 fire policies bearing No.
101600/3101669/0 in respect of Building, machinery and accessories and furniture

Polymat India P. Ltd. & Anr vs National Insur","Polymat India P. Ltd. filed a claim with National Insurance Co. Ltd. for losses due to a fire at their factory, covered by two fire insurance policies. The insurance company repudiated part of the claim, specifically for goods and machinery outside the factory shed, leading Polymat to file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The core dispute revolves around whether the insurance policies covered goods stored outside the factory building, despite the initial proposal form indicating otherwise.","The court focused on interpreting the terms of the insurance policy and the proposal form filled by Polymat India. Specifically, the court examined Clause 8 of the policy and the insured's negative response regarding goods stored in the open. The court considered whether the insured's subsequent letter requesting amendments to the policy, including coverage for goods outside the building, altered the initial agreement. No specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act or other laws are explicitly cited in the provided text.",Not available in document

Leave granted.
The principal question raised in this appeal in whether internet domain names are subject to the
legal norms applicable to other intellectual properties such as trade marks? The appellant which was
incorporated in 1995 registered several domain names like www.sifynet, www.sifymall.com,
www.sifyrealestate.com etc. in June 1999 with the internationally recognised Registrars, viz the
internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the World Intellectual
Property Organisation","Satyam Infoway Ltd. (SIL), the appellant, sued Siffynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd., the respondent, for passing off its business and services by using a deceptively similar domain name. SIL claimed prior use and goodwill in the name 'Sify' for its internet-related services. The dispute centered on whether domain names are subject to the same legal norms as trademarks.","The court analyzed the definition of 'trade mark', 'mark', 'goods', and 'services' under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, specifically sections 2(zb), 2(m), 2(j), and 2(z). It determined that a domain name can function as a business identifier and is capable of distinguishing services on the internet, thus falling within the scope of trademark law. The court also applied the principles of passing off, emphasizing the likelihood of confusion among consumers and potential diversion of users due to similar domain names. Several prior High Court decisions regarding domain name disputes were cited and affirmed.",Not available in document

of a judgment and order dated 12th December, 1996 passed by the Andhra Pradesh
High Court.
""Goods"" : Meaning The said expression has been defined in Section 2(b) to, inter alia,
mean all kinds of moveable property and includes all materials, articles and
commodities. The amplitude of the said expression is required to be considered with
a view to answer the question involved in this appeal.
The expression 'goods' is not a term of art. Its meaning varies from statute to statute.

the Constitution to include all materials, commodities and articles. Commodi","Tata Consultancy Services appealed against the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding whether intellectual property contained in floppies, disks, or CD-ROMs constitutes 'goods' under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957.

This appeal is directed against the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi in Revision Petition No.2159 of 2002 confirming the order passed by the
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi as well as the order passed by the
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-II (District Forum ","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against M/s. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal after the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission upheld orders from lower consumer forums. The dispute arose from the insurance company's denial of a claim for stolen food grains, arguing that the policy covered burglary (defined as theft involving force or violence) and not simple theft. The respondent had a policy against burglary and/or housebreaking.","The court emphasized that the insurance policy is a contract binding on both parties, and the definition of 'burglary' within the policy requires force or violence. The court referred to Halsbury's Laws of England and cited English and American court decisions to support the interpretation that burglary, as defined in the policy, necessitates forcible and violent entry. The court held that the consumer forums erred in equating theft with burglary without the element of force or violence as stipulated in the policy.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, and the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-II, thus upholding the insurance company's repudiation of the claim."

The respondent filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (District
Forum) under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for brevity 'the Act') praying for
settlement of an insurance claim at Rs.75,000/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annu","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against M/s. Pushpalaya Printers regarding the repudiation of an insurance claim. The printer claimed damages to their building and printing press due to vibrations from a bulldozer operating nearby during road construction, which they argued was covered under the 'impact' clause of their insurance policy. The insurance company denied the claim, arguing the damage wasn't a direct impact by a road vehicle.","The court considered Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, under which the original complaint was filed. The court interpreted the word 'impact' in Clause 5 of the insurance policy, referencing dictionary definitions and the principle of *contra proferentem*, construing the ambiguity against the insurer. The court also cited *General Assurance Society Ltd. vs. Chandumull Jain & Anr.*, emphasizing the requirement of *uberrima fides* in insurance contracts.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's order (with modifications from the State Commission's order) that the insurance company was liable to pay compensation for the damages."

The controversy raised in these appeals by special leave and Transfer Petitions
basically relates to the competence of the State Government to fix the State Advised
Price for purchase of sugarcane by an occupier of a sugar factory over and above the
minimum price fixed by the Central Government. The validity of the procedure
adopted for ensuring the payment of the aforesaid price to a sugarcane grower is also

Sugar Mills Association regarding the competence of the State Government to fix a State Advised Price for sugarcane, which is higher than the minimum price fixed by the Central Government. The sugarcane growers are essentially seeking a higher, more remunerative price for their sugarcane crop. The core grievance revolves around whether the State Government has the authority to mandate a price exceeding the centrally determined minimum.","The court considered the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, the Essential Commodities Act, and the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953. Precedents like *Maharashtra Rajya Sahkari Sakkar Karkhana Sangh Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra* were examined. The central issue was whether the Central Government's fixation of a minimum price preempted the State Government's power to fix a higher, more remunerative price, considering the local conditions and by-products revenue of sugar mills. The arguments centered on interpreting the scope of powers granted to both the Central and State governments under relevant legislation.",Not available in document

The short question involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order
dated 27.7.2001 in C.R.P. No. 2003 of 1998-B passed by the High Court of Kerala at
Ernakulam is as to whether on restoration of a suit an order of injunction passed is
automatically revived or not.
An order of injunction can be passed under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. Such an order can also be passed by the Court in exercise of its
inherent jurisdiction in the event the prayer for grant of injunction does not fall
Va",The case involves an appeal regarding whether an order of injunction passed in a suit is automatically revived upon the restoration of the suit. The parties are Vareed Jacob (petitioner) and Sosamma Geevarghese & Ors (respondents). The specific product or service and the main grievance are not explicitly detailed in the provided text.,"The court analyzes the distinction between incidental and supplemental proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure, particularly concerning orders of injunction. It examines precedents regarding the revival of interlocutory orders upon restoration of suits, differentiating between ancillary orders that aid the final decision and supplemental orders that may not directly impact the suit's outcome. The court discusses Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 94, emphasizing that the power to issue injunctions depends on the statute's scheme and conferred powers.","The document only states ""Leave granted."" which means the court allowed the appeal to be heard. The final outcome of the appeal itself (whether it was allowed or dismissed on its merits) is not available in the provided text."

The Legislature of State of Assam and the Parliament took legislative measures to
allay the difficulties faced by the small scale industries. The State of Assam made
rules known as The Assam Preferential Stores Purchase Rules in the year 1972. The
said rules having not served its purpose, the Assam Preferential Stores Purchase Act,
1989 (for short ""the 1989 Act"") was enacted which received the assent of the
Governor on 14th July, 1989. The said Act was enacted for encouraging growth of
industries in the State of Assam specially small scale and cottage industries and for
taking measures ancillary thereto. The State intended to patronize the products of the
small scale and cottage industries on p","Assam Small Scale Ind. Dev. Corp. Ltd. (ASIDC) appealed against M/s. J.D. Pharmaceuticals regarding delayed payments for medicines supplied by the latter. J.D. Pharmaceuticals, a small-scale industry, claimed non-payment for medicines supplied to ASIDC based on purchase orders between 1991 and 1993. The core grievance revolves around the outstanding amount and the applicability of the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993.","The court analyzed the Assam Preferential Stores Purchase Act, 1989, particularly Section 7(1)(c) and Schedule III, concerning preferences for small-scale industries and the role of ASIDC. It also examined the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993, specifically Sections 4 and 5 regarding interest on delayed payments.

The challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 26.4.2002 passed by the National Consumers
Disputes Redressal Commission (in short `the Commission') in Revision Petition No. 1460 of 2000.
Briefly stated, the facts are as follows:
The respondent","Brij Pal Sharma filed appeals against the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) regarding the cancellation of housing schemes (Karpoori Puram and Govindpuram) after the appellant had deposited money for plots. The appellant's grievance was that the GDA floated new schemes on the same land, depriving citizens of their allotments and causing financial loss. The case involves housing plots under self-financing schemes.","The court relied on the precedent set in *Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh* (2004) 5 SCC 65, which addressed similar issues of scheme cancellations and unfair practices by the GDA. The court upheld the National Commission's decision to award interest at 18% per annum as damages and compensation for the non-allotment of plots, considering it a just and fair remedy for the GDA's actions.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the National Commission's decision to award interest at 18% per annum as damages and compensation; the court clarified that the dismissal should not be construed as approval of the conduct of the statutory authority."

These appeals involving common questions of fact and law were taken up for hearing
together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.
The basic fact of the matter is","The case involves appeals against decisions related to Life Insurance Corporation's (LIC) Salary Savings Scheme. Employees enrolled in the scheme, where premiums were to be deducted from their salaries by the employer and remitted to LIC. The dispute arose when employers failed to deduct premiums, leading to policy lapses and subsequent claims by the employees' heirs after their death, which LIC denied.","The judgment refers to a previous case, Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking Vs. Basanti Devi, which throws light on the issue. The core legal question revolves around whether the employer acted as an agent of the LIC or the employee in the Salary Savings Scheme. The court examines the terms of the scheme and the correspondence between LIC and the employer to determine liability for the non-payment of premiums.","The document does not provide the final outcome of the appeals. It only outlines the facts, arguments, and the legal questions involved."

1. The defendants in Civil Suit No. 8A of 2004 on the file of the District court of Mandaleshwar are
the appellants. That suit was filed by the respondent herein for a declaration that the defendants do
not have any right to sell Pan Masala, Gutkha, Supari and Supari Mix or any other goods under the
trade mark 'Manikchan","Dhariwal Industries Ltd. appealed against an interim injunction preventing them from selling Pan Masala, Gutkha, Supari, and Supari Mix under the trademark 'Manikchand', arguing it was not deceptively similar to M/s M.S.S. Food Products' trademark 'Malikchand'. The plaintiff, M.S.S. Food Products, claimed prior use of 'Malikchand' and alleged that Dhariwal's products were of substandard quality, causing irreparable injury to their reputation.","The court considered Section 27 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which preserves the right of action for passing off goods even without a registered trademark.

The United Insurance Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ""insurer"") and its Branch
Manager, Purulia Branch call in question legality of the order passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission (in short the ""National Commission"") upholding the order of the
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (in short the ""State Commission""). The revision
filed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (in short the ""Act"") was dismissed. The respondent
(hereinafter referred to as the ""complainant"") had lodged a complaint before the District Consumers
Disputes Redressal Forum, Purulia (in short the ""District Forum"") alleging that the appellants had
erroneously repudiated the claim made by him for the damage suffered by him on account of an
accident covered by the policy of insurance taken by him.
The factual background in a nutshell is as follows:
The complainant is the owner of an Ambassador Diesel Car which was registered as a
taxi and was hired by the Executive Engineer, Agri-Make Division, Purulia for official
use. The vehicle was the subject mat","Samir Chandra Chaudhary filed a complaint against United India Insurance Co. Ltd. for erroneously repudiating his insurance claim for damages to his taxi caused by a falling Eucalyptus tree. The insurance company argued the damage was due to a storm, which was excluded under the policy. The dispute centers around whether the damage was caused by a storm, and thus excluded from coverage under the insurance policy.","The court considered the exclusion clause in the insurance policy regarding special perils like storms. It analyzed the conflicting evidence, including the initial statements indicating a storm and a later letter from meteorological authorities suggesting otherwise. The court cited Section 31 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and the principle that admissions are strong evidence against the party making them, shifting the burden of proof to explain or disprove the admission.","The appeal was disposed of by remitting the matter to the National Commission for a fresh hearing, allowing both parties to present additional evidence. No order was made as to costs."

All these appeals have been filed against the common Judgment passed by the Full Bench of the
Karnataka High Court in five Writ Appeals.
Under the Mysore Land Revenue (Amendment Rules), 1960 [hereinafter being referred to as ""Rules
of 1960""], certain lands were granted to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Initially, these lands were given to them on temporary lease and later by virtue of Rule 43-J of Rules
of 1960, these lands were given to them permanently with a restriction that the grantees shall not
alienate these lands to third parties for a period of 15 years. These lands were granted to them
during the period 1959-65.","The case involves a dispute over land grants made to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the Mysore Land Revenue (Amendment Rules), 1960. These lands were initially leased and later granted permanently with a restriction on alienation for 15 years. The original allottees transferred the properties to third parties, and the allottees or their successors sought restoration of the lands under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978, claiming the transfers were void.","The court analyzed Rule 43-J of the Mysore Land Revenue (Amendment) Rules, 1960, and its relationship to Rule 43-G, which contains conditions restricting alienation. The Karnataka High Court Full Bench had held that Rule 43-G's restrictions did not apply to grants under Rule 43-J. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that Rule 43-J is an enabling provision and the government, as the paramount title-holder, could impose conditions not against the law, binding the grantees.",Not available in document

2. The present appeal is filed by the Haryana Seeds Development Corporation Ltd. ('Corporation' for
short) against the order passed by the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Kaithal,
confirmed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission","Sadhu Singh filed a complaint against Haryana Seeds Development Corporation Ltd. and Dhundwa Cooperative Credit & Service Society alleging that the wheat seeds he purchased were of substandard quality, resulting in poor germination and crop loss. He sought compensation for the price of seeds, labor charges, irrigation costs, loss of crop, and mental torture. The District Forum, State Commission, and National Commission all ruled in favor of the complainant.","The primary legal issue revolved around the assessment of evidence, specifically the report of the Expert Committee constituted by the appellant. The court found that the National Commission erred in deeming the Expert Committee's report ambiguous, as the report clearly stated that the variation in crop condition was not attributable to the quality of the seeds but to other factors. The court did not explicitly cite specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act, but its analysis focused on the proper evaluation of expert evidence in consumer disputes.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the District Forum, State Commission, and National Commission, and dismissed the complaint. The amount deposited by the appellant was ordered to be refunded."

In this appeal an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(hereinafter referred to as the ""National Commission"") is challenged to the extent that the National
Commission had awarded two lacs compensation which was to be paid by the appellant to the
respondent. The appellant held an auction of booth sites plots/building at No.90, Sector 9 at
Panchkula on free hold basis in 1986. The respondent bid for one booth/ site plot which was
accepted by the appellant. An allotment letter was issued on 12th January, 1987 to the respondent in
which it was mentioned that the allotted area of the booth/ site was 45.37 sq. meters including the
side verandah at a price of Rs.2,53,000/- which could be paid in instalments. After adjusting the
earnest money deposited, the respondent was required to pay the balance of 25% of the price of the
plot within 30 days upon which the possession of the booth site would be given. The balance amount
of the purchase price of Rs.1,89,750.00 was payable in ten half yearly instalments, the firs","Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) auctioned a booth site to B.K. Sood in 1986, but Sood alleged deficiencies in the service, including a smaller area than advertised and unauthorized structures nearby, leading to a complaint before the State Consumer Redressal Commission. Sood sought removal of deficiencies and compensation for losses and mental agony due to HUDA's alleged failure in discharging their duties. The dispute centers around the alleged deficiency in service provided by HUDA regarding the allotted booth site.","The court primarily relied on Section 24-A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which mandates the dismissal of complaints filed beyond the two-year limitation period unless sufficient cause for the delay is shown. The court found that the respondent's complaint was filed significantly after the cause of action arose (possession of the booth and installation of bhatties), and no condonation of delay was requested. Therefore, the claim was barred by limitation under Section 24A.","The appeal was allowed, and the National Commission's decision directing HUDA to pay compensation to the respondent was set aside due to the complaint being barred by limitation."

The Municipal Corporation considered these signboards as advertisements under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, requiring prior permission and payment, while the bank argued they were merely directional for existing customers and not advertisements. The dispute centers around whether the signboards constitute advertisements under the relevant municipal act.","The court analyzed Sections 328 and 328A of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act 1888, focusing on the definitions of 'sky-sign' and 'advertisement.' It considered whether the signboards were in the nature of an advertisement, announcement, or direction visible against the sky. The court also referred to the precedent set in *Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay Vs. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.*, which supported the view that such signboards could be considered advertisements.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the signboards constituted advertisements requiring permission from the Municipal Corporation."

Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned Single judge of the Kerala
High Court in a Second Appeal filed by the respondents holding that the suit filed by the present
appellants as plaintiffs for mandatory injunction as well as for prohibitory injunction was not
maintainable.
The suit was filed in the following factual background:
The plaint schedule property originally belonged to Francis Severance, the father of
appellants 1 to 3 and grand-father of appellants 4 and 5. Francis Severance had four
children and one of the sons, Joseph Severnce, died in the year 1970. His widow was
Hilda Severance. Said Francis Severance died in the year 1966. After the death of
Francis Severance the plaint schedule property devolved on appellants 1 to 3. Shri
K.V. Mathew, the husband of the 2nd respondent and father of respondents 1 and 3
and the 4th respondent entered into an agreement of licence with appellants and
Hilda Severance with respect to the plaint schedule property under which permission
was granted to Mathew to construct a cinema theatre for a period of f","The case involves a dispute between Joseph Severance and others (appellants), the original licensors of a property, and Benny Mathew and others (respondents), the legal heirs of the licensee, regarding the possession of the property after the license agreement expired. The appellants sought a mandatory injunction to compel the respondents to vacate the property and a prohibitory injunction. The main grievance is that the respondents continued to occupy the property after the license was terminated.","The court analyzed whether the suit for mandatory injunction was maintainable given the delay in filing it after the license expired. It considered the concept of ""reasonable time"" for filing the suit, referencing precedents and legal lexicons to define the term. The court also noted that the High Court failed to formulate a substantial question of law as required by Section 100(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court determined that the licensor has control/possession through the licensee even after termination, and the licensee isn't immediately a trespasser, but the licensor must act promptly.","The appeal was allowed. The judgment of the High Court was set aside, and the judgments of the trial court and the first appellate court were restored, implying the mandatory and prohibitory injunctions were granted to the appellants."

Respondent No. 1 filed an election petition und","Kailash, the appellant, was declared elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council. Respondent No. 1, Nanhku, filed an election petition challenging Kailash's election. The dispute revolves around the High Court's refusal to take Kailash's written statement on record due to it being filed beyond the 90-day limitation period prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.","The court analyzed Section 87 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which states that the procedure under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) applies to election petitions ""as nearly as may be,"" subject to the Act's provisions and rules made thereunder. The court also considered the Allahabad High Court's rules regarding election petitions and Article 225 of the Constitution, which empowers the High Court to make rules of court.

Ltd. appealed against a Delhi High Court judgment that quashed a contract awarded to them by Container Corporation of India (CONCOR). The dispute arose from a tender for professional services for surveying containers and cargo, where Metcalfe & Hodgkinson Pvt.

The High Court emphasized that CONCOR was bound to observe the eligibility criteria scrupulously, and the absence of a license in the name of the appellant company was a critical deficiency.",The appeal was preferred against the High Court's decision to quash the award of contract to the appellant.

Background facts The parties herein entered into a Power Purchase Agreement on
31.03.1997 for short gestation liquid fuel based power project of 355 MW.
The said agreement contained an arbitration clause in Article 14 thereof.
Dispute The Plant was commissioned. In terms of the said agreement, the power generated in the
Plant constructed by the Respondent herein was to be supplied to the Appellant Corporation. The
price to be paid therefor by the Appellant included 'capacity charges' and 'variable charges'. Upon
commission of the Plant, various tests as regard capacity of the plant to generate electricity were
carri","The case involves a dispute between M/s Transmission Corporation of A.P. (Appellant) and M/s Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt. Ltd (Respondent) regarding the 'installed capacity' of a power plant constructed by the Respondent, from which the Appellant was purchasing power. The dispute arose when the Appellant sought to revise the capacity charges payable to the Respondent based on a different calculation method than what was previously agreed upon. The core issue revolves around the interpretation of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and the determination of the plant's installed capacity for billing purposes.","The judgment primarily revolves around determining the appropriate forum for resolving the dispute: whether it should be through arbitration as per the Power Purchase Agreement or under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) as per the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Reform Act, 1998 and the Electricity Act, 2003. The court considered arguments regarding the jurisdiction of the Civil Court versus the Commission, particularly concerning the interpretation of 'installed capacity' within the agreement. The applicability of Sections 37 and 50 of the 1998 Act and Section 86(1)(f) of the 2003 Act were debated in relation to the Commission's authority to arbitrate disputes between licensees or generating companies.",The High Court set aside the City Civil Court's order and granted an injunction restraining the Appellant from refixing the capacity of the Plant until the City Civil Court disposes of the OP. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal the High Court's decision.

Punjab State Electricity Board (for short 'the Board') is a statutory authority created
in terms of Section 5 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 inter alia for the purpose of
rationalization of the production and supply of electricity to the consumers. Supply
and distribution of electricity indisputably are public utility services. The
Respondents herein are agriculturists.
Punjab State Electricity Board Ltd vs Zora Singh & Ors on 11 Augu","The Punjab State Electricity Board Ltd. (the Board) appealed against a decision by the National Commission regarding complaints filed by agriculturists (Zora Singh & Ors.) due to deficiency in service. The agriculturists had applied for electricity connections, deposited security amounts, but did not receive the connections, leading them to file complaints alleging deficiency in service.","The court analyzed the statutory obligations of the Board under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, emphasizing the duty to provide electricity to consumers without undue delay. While Section 22 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 does not directly apply to the Board, the court noted that the principles contained therein indicate a similar duty. The court also considered the Board's regulations and circulars regarding the time limit for granting connections and the payment of interest on deposits.",Not available in document

The case also involved concerns about the requirement of filing affidavits with pleadings and the examination of witnesses.","The court analyzed various amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, including those related to affidavits (Section 26(2) and Order VI Rule 15(4)), examination of witnesses (Order XVIII Rule 4), and recording of evidence by commissioners (Order XVIII Rule 5 and Order XXVI Rule 4-A).

J U D G M E N T RUMA PAL, J.
In 1933 Dr. N. B. Parulekar and his wife Shanta, started a Newspaper called Sakal. In 1948, Dr.
Parulekar and Shanta promoted a company known as M/s. Sakal Papers Pvt. Limited, which is the
respondent No.1 and is referred to hereafter as 'the company"". Dr. Parulekar died in 1973. Shanta
died during the pendency of the appeal before this Court. The appeal which is now being prosecuted
by the daughter of Dr. Parulekar and Shanta, arises out of proceedings initiated by Shanta and the
appellant under Section 155 (as it stood in 1986) of the Companies Act, 1956 (referred to hereafter as
'the Act') in the Bombay ","The case involves a dispute over the transfer of shares in M/s. Sakal Papers Pvt. Ltd. The appellant, Smt. Claude-Lila Parulekar, challenged the transfer of 3417 and 93 shares, claiming a right of preemption, and also contested the issue and allotment of 17,666 shares to the Pawar group. The core grievance revolves around the alleged violation of preemption rights and irregularities in share transfers and allotments.","The judgment primarily focuses on Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, concerning the power of the court to rectify the register of members. The court interprets Section 155 as not allowing a person whose right as a member is yet to be established to apply for rectification by inclusion of their name. The court also refers to the case of Ammonia Supplies Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Modern Plastic Containers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of the Company Court for rectification.",Not available in document

The question involved in this civil appeal filed by the department is  whether contracts entered into
and executed by the assessee were contracts for sale and not works-contract.
M/s Kone Elevators (India) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""the assessee"") is a unit of M/s Kone
Corporation, Finland who are one of the pioneers in the manufacture of Hi-tech New Generation
Elevators in the world. M/s Kone Corporation, Finland has its operations spread over 37 countries
in the world. The assessee herein is a registered dealer falling in the jurisdiction of the Commercial
Tax Officer, R.P. Road Circle, Secunderabad, having its head office at 50, Vanagaram Road,
Aynambakkam, Madras, with branches at Vijaywada","The State of Andhra Pradesh appealed against M/s Kone Elevators (India) Ltd., disputing whether the contracts for elevators were 'contracts for sale' or 'works-contracts' under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957. The State argued that the installation was ancillary to the sale of lifts, while Kone Elevators claimed it was a works-contract involving manufacture, supply, installation, and commissioning, entitling them to deductions for labor charges.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(n) defining 'sale' and Section 2(1)(t) defining 'works contract' of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, along with Entry 82 of the First Schedule. The court considered the intention of the parties, the nature of the obligations, and the surrounding circumstances to determine whether the contract's main object was the transfer of property or the provision of work and labor, citing precedents like State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.","The Tax Revision Case filed by the department was dismissed, upholding the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal's decision that the transactions related to a 'works-contract' and allowing Kone Elevators the deduction of labor charges."

These two appeals by special leave impugn the common judgment of the High Court of Kerala
rendered in First appeals AS Nos. 393/97 (E) and 281/97 (E) setting aside the decree made by the
trial court in OS No. 647/95.
The appellants before us were the plaintiffs before the trial court in Original","S. Brahmanand and Ors (Plaintiffs) entered into an agreement with K. R. Muthugopal (D) and Ors (Defendants) for the sale of property. The dispute arose when the Defendants sold the property to third parties (Bhatt family) after the Plaintiffs were put in possession of a portion of the property, leading the Plaintiffs to file a suit for specific performance of the agreement. The main grievance is the refusal of the Defendants to execute the sale deed despite the agreement.","The primary legal issue revolved around the limitation period for filing the suit for specific performance under Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The High Court held that a date was fixed for performance, thus barring the suit by limitation. The Supreme Court considered whether the agreement specified a fixed date for performance or if the performance was contingent upon the resolution of pending legal issues, which would affect the applicable limitation period.",Not available in document

1. What is the nature of the function of the Chief Justice or his designate under
Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is the question that is posed
before us. The three judges bench decision in Konkan Rly. Corporation Ltd. v. Mehul
Construction Co. as approved by the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway
Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. has taken the view that it is
purely an administrative function, that it is neither judicial nor quasi-judicial and the
Chief Justice or his nominee performing the function under Section 11(6) of the Act,
cannot decide any contentious issue between the parties.

The principal question to be decided in these matters is the nature of the transaction by which
mobile phone connections are enjoyed. Is it a sale or is it a service or is it both? If it is a sale then the
States are legislatively competent to levy sales tax on the transaction under Entry 54 List II of the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. If it is a service then the Central Government alone can levy
service tax under Entry 97 of List I (or Entry 92C of List I after 2003). And if the nature of the
transaction partakes of the character of both sale and service, then the moot question would be
whether both legislative authorities could levy their separate taxes together or only one of them. The
contenders are the service providers on the one hand and the States on the other. It is the case of the
service providers (who are for the purposes of convenience referred to in this judgment a","Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL) and other service providers contested the levy of sales tax by various states on mobile phone connections, arguing that it was a service, taxable only by the Union Government, not a sale. The states contended that the transaction was a deemed sale under Article 366 (29A)(d) of the Constitution, allowing them to levy sales tax. The core dispute centered on whether providing mobile phone connections constitutes a sale, a service, or both, and consequently, which legislative authority had the power to tax the transaction.","The court considered whether the transaction was a sale under Entry 54 List II or a service under Entry 97 of List I (or Entry 92C of List I after 2003) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The judgment analyzes the applicability of the principle of res judicata, citing cases like Amalgamated Coalfields Ltd. Vs. Janapada Sabha and M/s. Radhasoami Satsang Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax to determine if previous decisions barred the current plea. The court also examined the definition of 'business', 'dealer', 'goods' and 'sale' under Sections 2(aa), (c), (d) and (h) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act.",Not available in document

Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by the National Consumer Redressal Commission,
New Delhi (in short the 'Commission'). The Commission held that as delay in handing over the
possession was clearly established and the reasons in price escalation of the house was not proved or
establ","The case involves a dispute between Chief Administrator PUDA (Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority) and Mrs. Shabnam Virk regarding the final price of a MIG (Super) flat allotted to Mrs. Virk under a scheme. PUDA demanded a higher price (Rs. 7.44 lacs) than the initially advertised tentative price (Rs. 6.3 lacs), citing price escalation, while Mrs. Virk claimed she was only liable to pay the advertised price. The grievance is about the increased cost of the flat.","The National Consumer Redressal Commission initially ruled in favor of Mrs. Virk, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision. The Supreme Court focused on the undertakings and affidavits submitted by Mrs. Virk, where she agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the allotment letter, which specified the higher price. The court interpreted the clause regarding price revision as not being solely dependent on an increase in construction costs.","The appeals by Chief Administrator PUDA were allowed, meaning Mrs. Shabnam Virk was liable to pay the increased price of Rs. 7.44 lacs for the flat; no costs were awarded."

The main grievance is the violation of constitutional rights and principles of natural justice in the termination process.","The judgment primarily focuses on the constitutional validity of the terminations under Articles 14, 21, and 311 of the Constitution of India, and whether principles of natural justice were followed. It examines whether the State had sufficient material to form a bona fide opinion that the selection processes were tainted and whether the terminations were justified based on the alleged corruption within the Public Service Commission.

Leave granted in both the special leave petitions.
These two appeals by special leave, arise out of a common judgment dated 25.1.2006 passed by the
Orissa High Court allowing Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 4769/2005 and 4768/2005 filed by Narayan
Mohanty (common fifth respondent in these two appeals). In the said petitions, Narayan Mohanty
had challenged the award of construction contracts to Jagdish Mandal and Laxman Sharma
(respective appellant in these appeals) in Upper Indravati Irrigation Project ('UIIP' for short). The
State, the Executive Engineer (Right Canal Division No.III), the Chief Engineer (UIIP), and
Superintending Engineer (UIIP) who were the common respondents 1 to 4 in the said two writ
petitions hold the same rank in these two appeals.
Facts in SLP [C] No.3196/2006 (re : first stretch)
2. The second Respondent, acting on behalf of the Water Resources Department, State of Orissa,
invited tenders ","Jagdish Mandal and Laxman Sharma were awarded construction contracts for the Upper Indravati Irrigation Project (UIIP). Narayan Mohanty, a competing bidder, challenged the award of these contracts, alleging irregularities in the tender process, specifically regarding the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) and quoted rates. The dispute centers around the validity of Mohanty's EMD and the evaluation of his tender by the Project Level Committee.","The judgment primarily focuses on the principles governing judicial review of tender processes and award of contracts, citing precedents like *Sterling Computers Ltd vs. M & N Publications Ltd* and *Tata Cellular vs. Union of India*. The court emphasizes that interference is warranted only in cases of material violation of tender terms, arbitrariness, irrationality, mala fides, or favoritism. The judgment does not explicitly mention or apply any specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the High Court's judgment that had quashed the award of contracts to Jagdish Mandal and Laxman Sharma and directed reconsideration of the tender. The Supreme Court found that the High Court had erred in its assessment of the tender process."

He sought replacement of the car or a refund of the purchase price along with compensation for losses and suffering. The dispute centers around whether the warranty obligated Maruti to replace the entire car or only the defective part.","The court analyzed Section 17 of the J&K Consumers Protection Act, 1988, under which the appeal was filed. The court considered the warranty conditions provided by Maruti, specifically clause (3) regarding Maruti's obligation to repair or replace defective parts. The court distinguished this case from situations where the contract of sale is silent on warranties, citing Corpus Juris Secundrum. The court also referred to the case of Jose Phillip Mampillil v. Premier Automobiles Ltd. (2004 (2) SCC 278) to mould the relief.","The appeal was partially allowed. The court directed Maruti to replace the defective clutch assembly at no cost to the respondent and awarded a consolidated sum of Rs. 50,000 as compensation for travel expenses, inconvenience, and litigation costs."

Ltd (the Respondent) to run a slaughterhouse owned by the Appellant for 10 years. The dispute arose after the Appellant issued an advertisement inviting applications for a fresh contract to run the slaughterhouse, despite the Respondent's prior license and proposal to modernize the facility. The core issue revolves around the rights to operate and modernize the slaughterhouse.","The judgment primarily focuses on the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporations Adhiniyam, 1959, specifically Sections 422 and 423, which outline the powers of the Municipal Commissioner regarding Corporation markets and slaughterhouses, as well as the opening of private markets and slaughterhouses.

Appellant calls in question legality of the judgment rendered by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi (in short the 'Commission'). The Commission upset the order of
the State Commission and held that the appellant was liable to pay to the respondent (hereinafter
referred to as the 'complainant') a sum of Rs.5 lakhs together with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date
of the complaint.
Factual position in a nutshell is essentially as follows:
Smt. Lalitha Devi Patel wife of the complainant had obtained a Janata Personal
Accident Policy for a sum of Rs.5 lakh in August, 1998, for which a premium was paid
and accepted and the policy was issued. The insured died on account of an accident
by way of falling into a well and drowning. FIR was lodged, autopsy was performed
and appellant was informed. Various documents were also furnished claiming
payment in spite of the policy. When the appellantCompany did not settle the claim,
a complaint came to be filed before the Madhya Pradesh Stat","The Oriental Insurance Company appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order to pay Munimahesh Patel Rs. 5 lakhs with interest, stemming from a claim under a Janata Personal Accident Policy taken out by Patel's deceased wife. The insurance company argued that the policy was obtained through misrepresentation, specifically regarding the insured's occupation.",The court noted that the proceedings before the Commission are summary in nature and not suitable for adjudicating complex factual disputes. The Commission itself accepted that the insured had made a wrong declaration about her occupation. The court held that the State Commission's direction to seek remedy in an appropriate court of law was more appropriate given the disputed facts.,"The appeal was allowed, and the National Commission's order was overturned, effectively denying the claim under the consumer protection forum.

The court considered whether the clause restricted Zaheer Khan's liberty to carry on his affairs and whether it was detrimental to him.",The appeals filed by Percept D'Markr against the order of the learned Single Judge were allowed and the arbitration petition filed by the appellant herein before the Single Judge was dismissed.

FACTS The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. The
other parties to these appeals were/are its Directors.
In the year 1965, one Rambhai Patel started a business of grinding and selling spices
under the name and style of 'Ramdev'. He had three sons and two daughters,
Arvindbhai, Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai were his sons. A partnership firm was

The dispute arose from family differences and the respondents' use of the 'Ramdev' name in their spice business, which the appellant claimed was deceptively similar and caused confusion. The appellant sought an injunction to restrain the respondents from using the 'Ramdev' trademark.","The judgment primarily focuses on the interpretation of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, specifically concerning trademark infringement, concurrent user rights, and bona fide use. The court analyzed Sections 15, 17, and 29 of the Act. The court considered whether the respondents' use of the 'Ramdev' name constituted infringement, taking into account the similarity of the marks, the potential for confusion, and the existence of user agreements.",The appeals were allowed in part and dismissed in part. The Supreme Court set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and restored the order passed by the learned Trial Judge with some modifications.

This appeal has been filed against the order passed by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practice
Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as ""the Commission"") dated 13.9.2004 in C.A.
No.193 of 2001.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
The case of the appellant is that after applying for a flat under the ""Indira Puram Housing Scheme""
in the year 1994, a reservation letter dated 30th March, 1994 was received by him and he was asked
to pay seven installments on the specified dates. The amount as well as the dates on which the
installments were to be paid was mentioned therein. The applicant started paying the installments
as demanded. Subsequently, he opted out for a HIG flat, which was also allotted to him vide letter
dated 17th May, 1994. ","Alok Shanker Pandey applied for a flat under a housing scheme in 1994, paid installments, and later opted for a HIG flat. After five years without receiving the flat, he requested a refund, which was granted without interest. He then sought compensation for unfair trade practices under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969.","The case was examined under Section 12B of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969, concerning unfair trade practices. The court considered the respondent's failure to demand the remaining amount or hand over possession of the flat, concluding it was a deficiency of service. The court cited Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. Vs. General Electric Co. 1994 Supp.(1) SCC 644 regarding interest rates but determined that 12% was appropriate for this case.","The appeal was partially allowed; the court modified the original judgment to include interest at 12% per annum on the installments from the date of payment until the date of refund, and additionally, interest at the same rate on the aforementioned interest from the date of payment of installments until the date of refund."

This appeal by Special Leave is filed against the order dated 11.04.2002, passed by the National
Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ('Commission' for short) in O.P.No. 21 of 1995.
The Facts
2. The Banglore Development Authority (Appellant herein, 'BDA' for short) introduced a ""Self
Financing Housing Scheme"" for construction of flats/houses in Banglore in the year 1982. The said
Scheme contemplated construction of three types of flats/houses categorized as Higher Income
Group, Middle Income Group, and Low Income Group ('HIG', 'MIG', and 'LIG' for short). Under the
said scheme an applicant for allotment wa",The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) appealed against the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission's order regarding a delay in delivering HIG houses to Syndicate Bank under a self-financing housing scheme. Syndicate Bank claimed deficiency in service due to the delay and sought interest and compensation. The core issue revolves around the BDA's failure to deliver the houses within a reasonable timeframe after receiving full payment.,"The court applied principles derived from previous cases like Lucknow Development Authority vs. M. K. Gupta and Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh, focusing on the obligations of development authorities to deliver allotted properties within a reasonable time. It considered factors like whether time was of the essence, justifiable reasons for delay, and negligence on the part of the authority. The court considered the relationship between the Development Authority and the applicant to be that of a seller and buyer, governed by the law of contracts.","The appeal outcome is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the Commission directed the appellant to pay interest at 18% per annum on Rs.53,00,000/- from the expiry of two years after the deposit of last installment up to date of handing over the possession."

1. The appellant was insured with the respondent-Employees' State Insurance
Corporation (for short ""the Corporation"") with Insurance No. 913644. The
employee's/appellant's contribution towards the insurance scheme under the
Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as ""the ESI Act"") was
being deducted regularly from his salary and deposited by his employer with the

Sonepat for her treatment for diabetes. However, the condition of his wife continued
to deteriorate. As alleged by the appellant, there were instances when the doctors
were not available even during emergencies.
Later, the appellant got his wife medically examined in a private hospital. The tests done revealed
that his wife had been diagnosed incorrectly in the ESI dispensary; and that the deterioration in the
condition of the appellant's wife was a direct result of the wrong diagnosis. The appellant filed a

The ESIC argued that the complainant was not a consumer and that the services were gratuitous.","The court analyzed the definition of 'consumer' and 'service' under Section 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, respectively, and considered the precedents set in *Indian Medical Association v. V.P. Shantha and Others*. The court examined whether the services provided by the ESI hospital were gratuitous or rendered for consideration, considering that contributions were regularly deducted from the employee's salary for the insurance scheme. The court also considered whether Section 74 read with Section 75 of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ousts the jurisdiction of the consumer forum.","The document is truncated, and the final outcome of the appeal is not available."

","The case involves ICICI Bank and Prakash Kaur & Ors, concerning the use of recovery agents by banks for debt collection. The dispute revolves around the abusive and coercive tactics employed by these agents, leading to harassment of borrowers who have defaulted on loans or credit card payments. The main grievance is the mental, physical, and emotional torture inflicted by recovery agents during the debt recovery process.","The judgment primarily focuses on the role and conduct of recovery agents employed by banks, particularly regarding the use of abusive language and methods outside the due process of law. While the judgment doesn't explicitly cite specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act, it implicitly addresses consumer rights related to fair and ethical debt collection practices. The court emphasizes the need for banks to be held vicariously liable for the actions of their agents and suggests stricter regulation by the RBI.","The document is an opinion of one judge concurring with another, and does not contain a final outcome of the appeal.

Challenge in these appeals is to the legality of the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the
Karnataka High Court holding that the Circular dated 23.10.1999 (Circular No.31/1999-2000) is
valid and Circular No.5/1996-97 dated 12","M/s Binani Industries Ltd. appealed against the Karnataka High Court's judgment upholding the validity of a circular that allowed taxation under both Sections 5 and 5-C of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957. The dispute centered on whether goods already taxed under Section 5 could be taxed again under Section 5-C, which concerns the transfer of the right to use goods, including leased machinery and vehicles. The appellant argued that a subsequent proviso clarified that goods taxed under Section 5 should not be taxed again under Section 5-C.","The court analyzed Sections 5-C, 12-A, and 21 of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, focusing on the interpretation of a proviso added to Section 5-C. The appellant argued that the proviso was clarificatory and should be applied retrospectively, preventing double taxation. The court considered the Finance Minister's speech indicating the proviso was intended as a clarificatory measure providing additional benefit or relief. The court also cited Zile Singh v. State of Haryana and Ors. (2004 (8) SCC 1) regarding the determination of whether a proviso is clarificatory.",Not available in document

1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 27th October 2005 of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court whereby the order of the trial court dated 11thDecember 2003 rejecting an
application moved by the appellants under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure
praying for the grant of ad-interim injunction, has been confirmed.
3. The plaintiffs-appellants M/s. Heinz Italia S R L is the proprietor of the trademark ""Glucon-D""
which has been registered in India under Registration No. 305664 (Class 30) under The Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (hereinafter called the ""Act""). This trademark had earlier been
registered in the name of Glaxo on 21st May, 1975 but subsequently vide deed of assignment dated
30th September 1994 had been assigned to the first petitioner along with the goodwill etc. Glaxo
Laboratories had also assigned their rights in the artistic work used on the packaging. The
plaintiffs-appellants thereupon used the trademark ""Glucon-D"" and the ""packaging"" from the year
1994 to 2002 without any interference and","M/s. Heinz Italia, proprietor of the trademark ""Glucon-D"", filed a suit against M/s. Dabur India for infringement of trademark and copyright, alleging that Dabur's product ""Glucose-D"" used deceptively similar packaging. Heinz Italia claimed prior use and goodwill associated with the ""Glucon-D"" mark. The dispute centered on whether Dabur's use of ""Glucose-D"" and its packaging infringed upon Heinz Italia's rights.","The court considered Sections 29 and 106 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, and Section 63 of the Copyright Act, along with principles of passing off. Precedents like Century Traders vs. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. were cited to emphasize the importance of prior user and phonetic similarity. The court found a remarkable phonetic similarity between ""Glucon-D"" and ""Glucose-D"" and noted the deceptive similarity in packaging, leading to a likelihood of consumer confusion.","The appeal was allowed, and the order of the trial court and the High Court were set aside. The application for ad-interim injunction was granted, restraining Dabur from using the trademark ""Glucose-D"" and deceptively similar packaging."

This appeal is directed against the order dated 11.8.2004 of the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission ('National Commission' for short) affirming the order dated 14.6.2004
passed by the Andhra Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ('State Commission'
for short).
2. The appellant is a 'common carrier' as defined in the Carriers Act, 1865 ('Act' for short). The
respondent entrusted a consignment (an Hydraulic Cylinder) measuring 2700 kg, covered by sale
invoice dated 30.4.1996 to the Appellant for transportation from Patancheru to Bharuch, the
consignee being ""self."" The Appellant issued Consignment Note/Lorry Receipt dated 10.5.1996 to
the Respondent in that behalf, wherein the declared value of the consign","M/s. Veljan Hydrair Ltd. entrusted a hydraulic cylinder to M/s. Transport Corporation of India Ltd. for transportation, but the consignment was lost. Veljan Hydrair filed a complaint alleging deficiency of service due to non-delivery, seeking compensation for the cost of the lost consignment. The Transport Corporation contested the claim based on lack of notice, limitation, and non-payment of freight charges.","The court analyzed Section 10 of the Carriers Act, 1865, regarding the requirement of notice for loss or injury to goods, and Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, concerning the limitation period for filing complaints. The court interpreted that Section 10 applies when the carrier informs of the loss, not when there is non-delivery and the carrier is still tracing the goods. The court also discussed the meaning of 'cause of action' in the context of limitation.","The appeal was dismissed, affirming the orders of the State Commission and National Commission, which directed the Transport Corporation to pay the value of the consignment less freight charges, with interest and costs."

2. Whether renewal of a licence granted to drive a motor vehicle which was originally
found to be forged would lead to any liability on the part of the insurance company is
the core question involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order
dated 9.10.2006 passed by National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New
Delhi in R.P. No. 2908 of 2006.
3. Respondent is the owner of the vehicle bearing No. HR-37A-5521. He got the said
vehicle insured on 10.11.2003 for one year, i.e., upto 9.11.2004. It met with an
accident on 20.04.2004 with a truck. The said vehicle was being driven by one Kulbir
Singh. Upon investigation made in this behalf, it was found that the licence bearing
No. 6604/R-91-92 held by Kulbir Singh was not issued by the Licensing Authority,
Solan.

It cited precedents like *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh* and *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Laxmi Narain Dhut*, emphasizing that a fake license cannot be validated by renewal and that the *Swaran Singh* ruling doesn't apply to own damage cases. The court held that the insurance company was not liable to indemnify the owner for his own losses due to the driver's fake license.","The appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission was set aside, meaning the insurance company was not held liable to pay the claim."

2. Respondent is an authority created under the Delhi Development Act, 1957 (for

Respondent floated a scheme known as Fifth Self Financing Housing Registration Scheme, 1982 (for

registered themselves; their registration numbers being 13463, 16602 and 13464. For the purpose of
allotment of flats, lots were drawn on various occasions, viz., in June, 1987, November, 1987, March,
1989, July, 1990, January, 1991, January, 1993. Appellants were not successful therein and, thus,
were unable to get flats in locality of their choice. The Scheme was closed. However, with a view to
give a chance to those who were not successful in the lots on the earlier occasions, a public","Poonam Verma and others, registrants under the Delhi Development Authority's (DDA) Fifth Self Financing Housing Registration Scheme, 1982, filed a complaint seeking allotment of flats in their preferred locality. They alleged unfair trade practice by the DDA for not considering them in future draws after they declined an allotment in Kondli-Gharoli. The dispute centers around the DDA's housing scheme and the appellants' claim to continued participation despite not accepting previous offers.","The court analyzed Section 41 and Section 56(2)(r) of the Delhi Development Act, 1957, determining that the Central Government's direction for out-of-turn allotment was beyond its jurisdiction as it pertained to a specific scheme rather than a policy decision for efficient administration. The court found that the Central Government had no quota under the Act or the Scheme and could not revive a closed scheme. The court also noted that the appellants' claims of unfair trade practice and deficiency of service had been previously rejected by consumer forums.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's judgment that the appellants had no legal right to allotment and that the Central Government's direction was without jurisdiction."

The Court cited the principle that it cannot add or substitute words in a statute. The Court distinguished the All India Judges' Association case, stating that it did not establish a principle that the judiciary should fix judges' salaries and that the directions in that case were passed sub silentio.","The appeal was allowed in part.

3. First Appellant is owner of a jute mill. In exercise of power conferred upon it under Section 3 of
the Essential Commodities Act, Government of India m","The Empire Jute Co. Ltd. challenged an order compelling them to purchase raw jute from The Jute Corporation of India Ltd. to manufacture B-Twill gunny bags, arguing against the compulsory purchase and the price fixation. The dispute arose from a Production Control Order issued under the Essential Commodities Act, with the appellant claiming the supplied jute was of inferior quality and seeking relief from compulsory purchase and price directives.","The judgment primarily focuses on the interpretation of contractual obligations and the implications of an interim order granted by the High Court. It examines Clause 5.0 of the sale agreement regarding payment terms and carrying costs for delayed delivery. The court determined that the appellant was liable for carrying costs due to their failure to take timely delivery, irrespective of any defects in the Letter of Credit, and directed arbitration to settle the quantum of these charges.","The appeals were allowed, setting aside the order that exempted the appellant from paying carrying costs, and the court directed the parties to settle the amount through arbitration."

of challenge in various litigations in this Court as well as in the High Courts. Diverse opinions have
been expressed in regard to the need for","The case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs. Union of India & Ors. involves a challenge to the Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2005 and the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, which provide for reservation of seats for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Central Educational Institutions. The petitioners opposed the reservation of 27% for OBCs, arguing against its validity and implementation. The core dispute revolves around the constitutional validity of reservations in educational institutions, particularly for OBCs.","The court examined Article 15(5) of the Constitution, inserted by the Ninety-Third Amendment, which allows the State to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes or for SCs and STs in admissions to educational institutions. The court also considered the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, specifically Section 3, which mandates reservation percentages. The judgment references previous cases like Unni Krishnan, J.P. & Ors. Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. and T.M.A. Pai Foundation & Ors. Vs.

R. V. RAVEENDRAN J.
This appeal is against the order dated 3.2.2004 passed by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission ('Commission' for short) in Revision Petition No. 1878 of 2000. It relates to
the question whether a land owner, who enters into an agreement with a builder, for construction of
an Apartment Building and for sharing of the constructed area, is a `consumer' entitled to maintain
a complaint against the builder as a service-provider under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
The agreement
2. The appellant is the owner of premises no. L-3, Kailash Colony, New Delhi. He entered into a
`collaboration agreement' dated 17.5.1991 with the first respondent, the terms of which are, in brief,
as follows :
(i) The owner shall place at the disposal of the builder, vacant possession of the
premises and authorize the builder to secure necessary sanctions, permissions and
approvals for demolition of the existing bui","Faqir Chand Gulati, the landowner, entered into a collaboration agreement with Uppal Agencies Pvt. Ltd., the builder, for the construction of an apartment building with a sharing arrangement of the constructed area. The landowner filed a complaint alleging deficiencies in construction and unauthorized deviations from the sanctioned plan, seeking completion certificates and other related documents. The central issue is whether the landowner qualifies as a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and whether the builder is a 'service provider'.","The court examined the definition of 'consumer', 'deficiency', and 'service' under Section 2(1)(d), 2(1)(g), and 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as it stood in 1994. The court analyzed whether the agreement between the landowner and builder constituted a hiring of services for consideration. The court considered whether the agreement was a joint venture or a service agreement, and whether the builder's activity fell within the definition of 'service' under the Act.",Not available in document

GUVNL appealed the Gujarat High Court's decision to appoint an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.","The appellant argued that the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically Section 86(1)(f) and Section 158, grants the State Commission exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between licensees and generating companies or to refer them to arbitration.

The dispute arose from the non-completion of the sale due to issues with obtaining a layout permit from HUDA and alleged breaches of the agreement. The appellants sought specific performance of the contract, which was initially dismissed by the trial court but later reversed by the High Court.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the agreement for sale and whether the vendees were ready and willing to perform their part of the contract. The court analyzed the clauses of the agreement, particularly those related to obtaining layout permission and the obligations of both parties. The court considered precedents related to specific performance of contracts and the readiness and willingness of the parties to fulfill their obligations. The judgment does not explicitly mention the Consumer Protection Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's judgment, and restored the trial court's judgment dismissing the suit for specific performance, finding that the plaintiffs were not ready and willing to perform their part of the contract."

The dispute centered on trademark infringement and passing off, with the Scotch Whisky Association claiming Khoday Distilleries was unfairly benefiting from the reputation of Scotch whisky.","The judgment primarily revolves around the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, specifically Section 11 concerning deceptive similarity and likelihood of causing confusion. The court considered arguments related to acquiescence, delay, and waiver, but ultimately focused on whether the 'Peter Scot' mark contravened Section 11. The court found that the use of 'Scot' in conjunction with other elements on the label created a likelihood of deception, leading consumers to believe the whisky was of Scottish origin.","The appeal by Khoday Distilleries Limited was dismissed, upholding the rectification of the 'Peter Scot' trademark registration in favor of The Scotch Whisky Association."

2. The respondent (Insured) obtained a standard F","National Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against M/s. Boghara Polyfab Pvt. Ltd. regarding a fire and special perils insurance policy. The dispute arose after the insured, Boghara Polyfab, suffered losses due to flooding and claimed under the policy, but later issued a full and final discharge voucher after allegedly being coerced into accepting a lower settlement amount. The core issue is whether a dispute can be referred to arbitration after a full and final discharge voucher has been given.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, specifically Section 11, concerning the appointment of arbitrators. The court considered precedents regarding the validity of discharge vouchers and whether they constitute a bar to arbitration, especially when allegations of coercion or undue influence are raised. The court analyzed whether the dispute regarding the validity of the discharge voucher itself is arbitrable.","The appeal was dismissed. The Supreme Court upheld the Bombay High Court's decision to refer the dispute to arbitration, finding that the question of whether the discharge voucher was given voluntarily or under coercion is a matter for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide."

2. This appeal is preferred against the order dated 21st September, 2006 passed by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the National
Commission) in R. P. No. 2638 of 2006.
3. Brief facts of the case which are necessary to dispose of the matter are recapitulated as under:-
4. The respondent Nitin Khandelwal had purchased the vehicle Mahindra Scorpio bearing
No.HR-18-8743 on 28.5.2003. On 27.9.2003, he had sent his vehicle to bring his children from
Jaipur. On the way, some unknown people stopped the vehicle, tied the driver and dumped him on
the way and snatched away the vehicle. The report was lodged by the driver at the police station and
the appellant Insurance Company was informed of the same. Thereafter, on 2.10.2003, the
respondent filed an insurance claim, which was rejected by the Insurance Company.
5. The appellant","National Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against Nitin Khandelwal regarding the rejection of his insurance claim for his stolen Mahindra Scorpio. The insurance company rejected the claim because the vehicle, insured for personal use, was allegedly being used as a taxi. Khandelwal filed a consumer complaint seeking compensation for the loss of his vehicle.","The court considered precedents like *United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Gian Singh*, *Jitendra Kumar v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.*, and *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh & Others*. The court distinguished the case from situations involving negligent driving and emphasized that in cases of theft, the nature of vehicle use is not germane to the insurance claim. The court held that the Insurance Company is liable to indemnify the owner of the vehicle when the insurer has obtained comprehensive policy for the loss caused to the insurer.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's order which affirmed the State Commission's decision to grant 75% of the insured amount to the respondent on a non-standard basis."

The dispute centered on whether the insurance policy covered the death of the owner/pillion rider under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the extent of the insurance company's liability. The main grievance was the Tribunal's determination that the insurance company was liable regardless of who was driving the motorcycle.","The court analyzed Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and cited precedents including *Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Jhuma Saha & Ors.*, *Dhanraj v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.*, *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Laxmi Narain Dhut*, *Prem Kumari & Ors. v. Prahlad Dev & Ors.* and *Oriental Insurance Co.

The court interpreted that Section 163-A does not apply when the owner of the vehicle is involved in the accident and that the insurance company's liability is governed by the terms of the contract, especially concerning coverage for the owner's death.","The appeal was allowed in part. The insurance company's liability was limited to Rs. 1,00,000 as per the terms of the insurance contract."

contention therein that the driver of the said tractor did not hold a valid and effective license.
2. Before the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal (The Tribunal), the driver of the said Tractor,
Sushil Kumar was examined. He categorically stated that he did not know how to drive a tractor and
he never even tried to learn driving of the tractor. He admitted that he had not been possessing any
valid driving license to drive a tractor. It was accepted by him that he had even never applied
therefor. He also, in answer to a question put to him in cross-examination, admitted that he did not
hold a ","The case involves an appeal by the dependents of a deceased tonga driver, Jagiru, who died from injuries sustained in a collision with a tractor driven by Sushil Kumar. The appellants sought compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. The insurance company contested liability, arguing the tractor driver lacked a valid license.","The court considered Section 147 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, emphasizing the owner's responsibility to ensure drivers possess valid licenses. It cited precedents like *United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Gian Chand*, *National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaran Singh*, and *National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Kusum Rai*, highlighting that insurance companies can avoid liability if the driver lacks a valid license, constituting a breach of the insurance contract. The court distinguished between fake licenses and expired licenses, focusing on the owner's conscious allowance of an unlicensed driver.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower courts' decisions that the insurance company was not liable due to the driver's lack of a valid license at the time of the accident."

1. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (the Act) was enacted to constitute Legal Services Authorities
to provide for free and competent legal service to the weaker sections of the society, to ensure that
opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other
disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes
justice o","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against Ajay Sinha regarding a disputed insurance claim. Sinha, an authorized distributor of Sony products, claimed a loss of goods due to burglary, but the insurance company repudiated the claim citing discrepancies in documents and a suspicious police report. The dispute centered on whether the Permanent Lok Adalat had jurisdiction to hear the case, given the pending criminal investigation related to the alleged burglary.","The court analyzed Section 22-C of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, which defines the jurisdiction of Permanent Lok Adalats, particularly the proviso excluding matters relating to non-compoundable offenses. The High Court initially held that because the matter related to a non-compoundable offense, the Permanent Lok Adalat lacked jurisdiction. However, the Division Bench overturned this, stating the pendency of a criminal case does not bar the Permanent Lok Adalat's jurisdiction.","The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal, holding that the pendency of a criminal case does not bar the Permanent Lok Adalat's jurisdiction."

The case revolves around a motor vehicle accident and the insurance policy covering the vehicle.","The Supreme Court analyzed Sections 4 and 5 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which prohibit minors from driving and place responsibility on vehicle owners to prevent unlicensed individuals from driving. The court cited precedents like *Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. vs. Prithvi Raj* and *National Insurance Co.Ltd. vs. Kaushalaya Devi & Ors.* to emphasize that an insurance company is not liable when the driver lacks a valid license.

Indian Kanoon - http://india","Satwant Kaur Sandhu appealed against New India Assurance Company Ltd.'s repudiation of her mediclaim policy claim after her husband's death. The insurance company rejected the claim, alleging that the deceased had concealed his pre-existing diabetic and renal conditions when obtaining the policy. The dispute centers around whether the non-disclosure of these conditions constituted a suppression of material facts, justifying the repudiation.","The court considered whether the insured's pre-existing conditions were material facts that should have been disclosed under the principle of *uberrimae fidei* (utmost good faith), which applies to insurance contracts. The court cited Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, noting its inapplicability to mediclaim policies, and referenced precedents like *United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. M.K.J. Corporation* and *Carter Vs. Boehm* to emphasize the duty of disclosure. The court interpreted ""material fact"" as any fact influencing a prudent insurer's judgment in assessing risk and setting premiums.","The Supreme Court upheld the repudiation of the claim, dismissing the appeal.

R.M. Lodha, J.
In this appeal by special leave an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
commission (hereinafter referred to as `National Commission') on October 1, 2001 is under
challenge. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ist, Agra (hereinafter referred to as
`District Forum') vide its order dated November 16, 2000 allowed the complaint filed by the present
respondent (for short, `the Complainant') and directed the present appellant (for short, `the Bank')
to pay to the complainant Rs. 2,47,154/- with interest @ 15% per annum from April 21, 1994 ","State Bank of India (SBI) appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order, which upheld the District Forum's decision directing SBI to compensate M/s B.S. Agricultural Industries (I) for deficiency in service. The complainant alleged that SBI failed to either collect payment for or return bills and GRs (Goods Receipts) related to the supply of engines and pump sets, causing financial loss. The core issue revolves around the bank's handling of the complainant's documents sent for collection.","The Supreme Court focused on Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which prescribes a two-year limitation period for filing complaints. The Court emphasized that consumer forums have a duty to examine the timeliness of complaints, citing precedents like *Union of India v. British India Corporation Ltd.* and *Haryana Urban Development Authority v. B.K. Sood*. The Court interpreted Section 24A as a mandatory provision, requiring dismissal of time-barred complaints unless sufficient cause for delay is shown and condoned with recorded reasons.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the orders of the National Commission, State Commission, and District Forum. The Court found that the complaint was time-barred under Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986."

Indian Kanoon","Amalendu Sahu filed a claim with Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. for damages to his car, insured under a comprehensive policy, after an accident. The insurance company rejected the claim, alleging the car was being used for hire, violating the policy terms. The complainant argued the car was lent as a gesture of goodwill and not for commercial hire.","The court considered precedents from the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) and the Supreme Court, which established that in cases of policy violations regarding the nature of vehicle use, claims should be settled on a non-standard basis. The court referred to guidelines issued by insurance companies for settling non-standard claims, specifically addressing breaches of policy conditions, including limitations on use.","The appeal was allowed in part. The Supreme Court directed the insurance company to pay a consolidated sum of Rs. 2,50,000 to the appellant without interest, acknowledging the breach of policy condition but rejecting the total repudiation of the claim."

1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal is filed against the judgment passed by National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (hereinafter called `the National Commission"" for short), allowing the First Appeal
filed by the respondent herein holding that the complaint filed by the respondent herein was tenable
relating to its grievance about the deficiency of service, under Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of The Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter called ""the Act"" for short) as amended.
3. The appellant had sent a detailed proposal for developing certain computer software for the
respondent at a cost of Rs.36 lacs on 11.2.1998. This proposal was accepted by the respondent who
sent the letter of intent indicating its intention to entrust the appellant with the development of the
said software. On 1","Birla Technologies Ltd. (appellant) and Neutral Glass and Allied Industries Ltd. (respondent) were in dispute over the development of computer software. The respondent alleged deficiency in service by the appellant regarding the software's modules. The core issue was whether the respondent qualified as a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, given that the software was used for commercial purposes.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d)(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as amended, to determine if the respondent was a 'consumer'. The National Commission initially held that the respondent was not a consumer under Section 2(1)(d)(i) because the goods were purchased for commercial purposes, but then incorrectly assumed the complaint was filed before the 2003 amendment to Section 2(1)(d)(ii). The Supreme Court found that since the complaint was filed after the amendment, and the services were for commercial purposes, the respondent could not be considered a consumer.","The appeal was allowed, the National Commission's order was set aside, and the complaint was dismissed with costs assessed at Rs. 50,000."

The application for leave to appeal is allowed. Civil appeal is admitted. The decision of the
Government of India to liberalize its economy with the intention of removing controls persuaded the
Indian Parliament to enact laws providing for checks and balances in the free economy. The laws
were required to be enacted, primarily, for the objective of taking measures to avoid
anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominance as well as to regulate mergers and takeovers
which result in distortion of the market. The earlier Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act,
1969 was not only found to be inadequate but also obsolete in certain respects, particularly, in the
light of international economic developments relating to competition law. Most countr","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) appealed against Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) regarding an alleged exclusive supply agreement with Indian Railways for rails. Jindal Steel & Powers Ltd. (the informant) claimed that SAIL abused its dominant position, violating Sections 3(4) and 4(1) of the Competition Act. The CCI directed an investigation, which SAIL challenged before the Competition Appellate Tribunal.","The judgment discusses the evolution of competition law globally and in India, highlighting the inadequacy of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969. It emphasizes the objectives of the Competition Act, 2002, which include preventing anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position, and regulating combinations that adversely affect competition, as outlined in Sections 3, 4, and 6. The court also mentions the inquisitorial, investigative, regulatory, adjudicatory, and advisory jurisdiction of the Competition Commission.",Not available in document

This appeal was referred by a two-Judge Bench to a larger bench on 30.11.2000, being of the view
that the decision of this Court in Oberai Forwarding Agency v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. - 2002
(2) SCC 407, required reconsideration. In turn, the three-Judge Bench has referred the matter to a
Constitution Bench on 29.3.2005. Factual Background :
2. The first respondent (also referred to as the `Assured' or the `consignor') is a
manufacturer of the cotton yarn. It took a policy of insurance from the second
respondent (National Insurance Co. Ltd, referred to as the `Insurer'), covering transit
risks between the period 11.5.1995 and 10.5.1996 in respect of cotton yarn sent by it
to various consignees through rail or road against theft, pilferage, non-delivery
and/or damage. The first respondent entrusted a consignment","Economic Transport Organisation is appealing a decision ordering them to pay compensation for damage to a consignment of cotton yarn. M/s Charan Spinning Mills, the consignor, had insured the goods with National Insurance Co. Ltd., who settled the claim after the goods were damaged during transport by Economic Transport Organisation. The consignor and insurer jointly filed a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, alleging deficiency in service due to the carrier's negligence.","The case revolves around the interpretation of 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and the rights of an insurer as a subrogee or assignee. The court is reconsidering the precedent set in Oberai Forwarding Agency, which distinguished between subrogation and assignment, holding that an assignee cannot file a complaint under the Act. The court is examining whether the insurer, having received a letter of subrogation-cum-special power of attorney, can maintain a complaint against the carrier for deficiency in service.",The final outcome is not available in this document. The case was referred to a larger bench for reconsideration of a previous decision.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 30th August, 2000 passed by","Kusum Sharma and others filed a complaint against Batra Hospital and associated doctors alleging medical negligence in the treatment of Shri R.K. Sharma, who died after undergoing surgery for a tumor. The appellants claimed deficiency in service and lack of informed consent, attributing the death to the hospital's negligence. The core dispute revolves around the appropriateness of the surgical approach, alleged damage to the pancreas, and post-operative complications.","The appellants filed a complaint under section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, claiming compensation for deficiency in services and medical negligence.

Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.
1. The Maharshi Dayanand University (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") has questioned the
correctness of the order in Revision Petition No.132/06 passed by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter called ""National Commission"") dated 27.4.2007
whereby the National Commission has allowed the Revision Petition and the order passed by the
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as ""State Commission"")
has been set aside simultaneously restoring the order passed by the District Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum, Gurgaon (hereinafter called as ""District Forum""). A further direction has been
issued to the appellant to issue the B.Ed. Degree to the respondent on the basis of the results of her
examinations which were held in December, 1998.
2. The dispute arose when the respondent felt aggrieved by the action of the appellant refusing to
confer the degree of B.Ed. on her. The background of the facts giving rise to the case was","Maharshi Dayanand University appealed against Surjeet Kaur regarding the refusal to award her a B.Ed. degree. Kaur pursued both M.A. and B.Ed. courses simultaneously, violating university rules, and the university initially cancelled her B.Ed. examination. Despite later appearing for and passing the B.Ed. examination under a general notification, the university still refused to confer the degree, leading Kaur to file a complaint with the District Forum.","The court analyzed Clause 17 of the General Rules of Examination, which prohibits simultaneous enrollment in two full-time courses. It cited precedents like State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Renuka Singla & Ors. and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Ashrafulla Khan & Ors. to emphasize that courts cannot direct actions contrary to statutory provisions. The court also addressed the issue of estoppel, stating that it does not apply against a statute, and referred to Bihar School Examination Board Vs. Suresh Prasad Sinha regarding the competence of consumer forums in educational matters.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by Maharshi Dayanand University, setting aside the National Commission's order and upholding the university's decision to withhold the B.Ed. degree from Surjeet Kaur."

R. V. RAVEENDRAN J., The appellant (Man Kaur, who died during the pendency of this appeal and
is represented by her Legal Representatives) was the defendant in a suit for specific performance of
an agreement of sale, filed by the respondent. For convenience the appellant and respondent will

2. The appellant Man Kaur was the owner of the suit property, a plot admeasuring 1000 sq.yards
with the building thereon, identified as `Annexe No 508' situated in Sector-18B, Chandigarh. The
respondent-plaintiff was, at all the relevant points of time, a Non-Resident Indian living in United

her husband and attorney holder Kartar Singh, as vendor, and plaintiff represented by his attorney
holder Paramjit Singh, as purchaser. The material terms of the said agreement were :
(i) The defendant s","Man Kaur, the defendant (now deceased, represented by legal representatives), was sued by Hartar Singh Sangha, the plaintiff, for specific performance of an agreement of sale for a property in Chandigarh. The plaintiff, an NRI, alleged that the defendant failed to execute the sale deed despite the plaintiff being ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. The defendant contended that the plaintiff breached the contract by failing to arrange funds and that the agreement was rescinded.","The court analyzed Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act 1963, which requires the plaintiff in a suit for specific performance to prove continuous readiness and willingness to perform the essential terms of the contract. The court considered precedents regarding the importance of the plaintiff's conduct before and after filing the suit to determine readiness and willingness. The court also addressed the issue of whether the agreement provided only for damages in case of breach, or also for specific performance.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower courts' decisions that the plaintiff was entitled to specific performance of the agreement of sale."

R.V.RAVEENDRAN, J.
Leave granted. The general scope of Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (`Code' for short) and
the question whether the said section empowers the court to refer the parties to a suit to arbitration
without the consent of both parties, arise for consideration in this appeal.
2. The second respondent (Cochin Port Trust) entrusted the work of construction of certain bridges
and roads to the appellants under an agreement dated 20.4.2001. The appellants sub-contracted a
part of the said work to the first respondent under an agreement dated 1.8.2001. It is not in dispute
that the agreement between the appellants and the first respondent did not contain any provision
for reference of the disputes to arbitration.
3. The first respondent filed a suit against the appell","Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. and another (appellants) were involved in a dispute with Cherian Varkey Construction Co. (P) Ltd. and others (respondents) regarding a sub-contract for construction work. The first respondent filed a suit against the appellants for recovery of money, and the trial court, under Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure, referred the matter to arbitration despite the appellants' disagreement. This appeal concerns whether consent is required for such a referral.","The judgment analyzes Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Order 10 Rule 1A, focusing on the procedure for implementing alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The court examines the object, purpose, scope, and tenor of these provisions, noting anomalies and inconsistencies in the drafting of Section 89, particularly the mixing of definitions for 'mediation' and 'judicial settlement'. The court also analyzes the requirement of consent of all parties for reference to arbitration under Section 89 of the Code.",The document does not state the final outcome of the appeal. It focuses on analyzing the legal issues and procedures related to Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

4. In so far as the case of the ","M/s. Kranti Associates Pvt. Ltd. (builder) and Corporation Bank filed appeals against the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). The dispute likely involves a consumer complaint related to the builder's services, as the NCDRC's order dismissed the builder's revision petition.","The court analyzed Sections 2(k), 9(c), 20, 21, 22, and 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, to determine the jurisdiction and powers of the National Commission. The court emphasized the necessity of the National Commission to provide reasoned orders, drawing on precedents that highlight the importance of speaking orders from quasi-judicial bodies to ensure fairness and transparency.",The appeal filed by the builder was allowed because the National Commission dismissed the revision petition without providing any reasons. The outcome of the appeal filed by Corporation Bank is not available in this excerpt.

The appellant claimed the insurance company wrongly rejected their claim after a railway accident damaged the consignment. The dispute centers on whether the insurance company was justified in repudiating the claim based on alleged violations of policy terms.,"The judgment analyzes whether the insurance company was justified in repudiating the claim based on the appellant's alleged failure to declare each consignment, removing goods from the accident site without a survey, and contributing to the losses through negligence. The court considered precedents regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts, the concept of 'insurable interest,' and the jurisdiction of consumer forums. The specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act are not explicitly mentioned, but the case revolves around the interpretation and application of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy within the framework of consumer protection law.",Not available in document

The Tribunal dismissed the appeals, stating it lacked jurisdiction to decide on the validity of the regulations framed by the Central Commission. The core issue revolves around the jurisdiction of the Appellate Tribunal to review regulations made by the CERC under the Electricity Act, 2003.","The Supreme Court examined Sections 111 and 121 of the Electricity Act, 2003, to determine the jurisdiction of the Appellate Tribunal. The court analyzed whether the Tribunal had the power of judicial review over the CERC's regulations.

1. This appeal is directed against the Order dated 21st February, 2006 passed by the National
Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the `National Commission'),
New Delhi where it dismissed the review petition preferred by the Punjab and Haryana State
Electricity Board (for short `Electricity Board') against the Order dated 16th August, 2005. One

Punjab State Electricity Board & Anr vs Ashwani Kumar on 8 July, 2010
India","The Punjab State Electricity Board appealed against the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission's order dismissing their review petition. The dispute arose from the Electricity Board's attempt to club two separate electricity connections, one in the name of Kartari Devi (later used by Ashwani Kumar) and another in the name of Janak Raj (later used by Sudesh Mahajan), claiming they were in the same premises and thus subject to higher tariffs.","The court analyzed the electric supply regulations framed under Section 49 and Sub Section (j) of Section 79 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948, focusing on provisions related to single connections, new connections in the same premises, and the obligation to club connections. The court interpreted these regulations to prevent consumers from avoiding higher tariffs by using multiple connections in the same premises and emphasized the Electricity Board's right to treat connections as clubbed if such mischief is detected.",Not available in document

2. Of the two appeals by special leave, one has been preferred by Shimnit Utsch India Private
Limited (for short, `Shimnit') being aggrieved by the judgment dated June 27, 2006 of the Calcutta
High Court whereby the Division Bench dismissed their appeal and affirmed the order dated
February 20, 2006 of the Single Judge dismissing their writ petition and the other at the instance of
M/s Tonnjes Eastern Security Technologies Private Limited (for short, `Tonnjes') challenging the
order dated March 23, 2010 wher","Shimnit Utsch India Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Tonnjes Eastern Security Technologies Private Limited filed appeals challenging decisions of the Calcutta and Orissa High Courts, respectively. The dispute concerns the necessity for State Governments to maintain conditions related to experience in foreign countries and minimum annual turnover in Notices Inviting Tenders (NIT) for High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) after a previous Supreme Court decision upheld such conditions. The core issue is whether states can relax these conditions after the Association of Registration Plates case.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, specifically Rule 50 and Section 109, along with the Motor Vehicles (New High Security Registration Plates) Order, 2001. The court refers to its earlier decision in Association of Registration Plates v. Union of India, which upheld the conditions of experience in foreign countries and minimum annual turnover. The central question is whether the states are bound by or can deviate from the guidelines established in the Association of Registration Plates case.",Not available in document

                           JUDGMENT
K. S. Radhakrishnan, J.
The question that falls for consideration in this case is whether an assessee (local manufacturer) is
eligible to get exemption under sub-section (3) of Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for
short `CST Act'), if the penultimate sale effected in favour of the exporter is inextricably connected
with the export of goods outside the territory of India.
2. This Court in Md. Serajuddin & Others v. State of Orissa (1975) 2 SCC 47, held that, under Article
286 of the Constitution, the sale which was not liable to tax under the State Sales Tax was only the
actual sale by the exporter, but the benefit of export sale did not extend to the penultimate sale to
the Indian exporter for the purpose of export. This led to the insertion of sub- section (3) of Section
5","The State of Karnataka appealed against Azad Coach Builders Pvt. Ltd. regarding the eligibility for exemption under Section 5(3) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. Azad Coach Builders manufactured bus bodies for Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (Telco) based on specifications from a foreign buyer, Lanka Ashok Layland Ltd., and claimed exemption on these sales as penultimate sales in the course of export, which was initially rejected by the Assessing Authority.","The court considered whether the bus bodies supplied by Azad Coach Builders were the 'same goods' as the buses exported by Telco, referring to precedents like *Sterling Foods* and *Vijayalaxmi Cashew Company* which advocated the 'same goods' theory. The court also examined the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Amending Act 103 of 1976, which introduced Section 5(3) to exempt penultimate sales inextricably connected with export.",The document does not contain the final decision of the Supreme Court.

Companies (Second Amendment) Act 2002 (`Amendment Act' for short) providing for the
constitution of National Company Law Tribunal (`NCLT' or `Tribunal') and National Company Law
Appellate Tribunal (`NCLAT' or `Appellate Tr","The Union of India and the Madras Bar Association filed appeals against an order of the Madras High Court concerning the constitutional validity of Chapters 1B and 1C of the Companies Act, 1956, as amended by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act 2002. These chapters provided for the constitution of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The Madras Bar Association challenged the legislative competence of Parliament to vest judicial functions traditionally performed by High Courts in these Tribunals, arguing it violated the doctrine of separation of powers and independence of the judiciary.","The judgment analyzes the constitutional validity of provisions within the Companies Act related to the establishment and functioning of the NCLT and NCLAT. The court examined specific sections (e.g., 10FB, 10FD, 10FE, 10FF, 10FL(2), 10FO, 10FR(3), 10FT and 10FX) to determine if they breached the basic principles of Rule of Law, Separation of Powers, and Independence of the Judiciary. Precedents like S. P. Sampath Kumar vs. Union of India, L. Chandrakumar v. Union of India, Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar Association and State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Co-operative Society were cited regarding the establishment of alternative institutional mechanisms.","The Madras High Court initially held that creating the NCLT and vesting powers previously held by High Courts and the Company Law Board was not unconstitutional, but identified defects in several provisions of the Act. The Union of India accepted that some defects needed correction and agreed to amend those provisions, while contesting the High Court's findings on other provisions; the final outcome of the appeals is not explicitly stated in the provided text."

upheld the finding of the State Consumer Forum. The order of the National Commission runs as
follows:
""Heard. The State Commission after elaborate discussion has come to the conclusion that there was
no negligence on the part of the respondent doctor. All possible care was taken by the respondent in
treating the petitioner. The State Commission has also recorded a finding that no expert opinion was
produced by the petitioner to prove that the line of treatment adopted by the respondent hospital
was wrong or was due to negligence of respondent doctor.

Kishan Rao filed a complaint against Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital alleging medical negligence in the treatment of his wife, who was admitted with fever and chills but allegedly treated for typhoid instead of malaria, leading to her death. The complainant argued that the hospital's negligence caused his wife's condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in her death at another hospital. The dispute centers around the alleged wrong diagnosis and treatment provided by the respondent hospital.","The court considered whether expert evidence was necessary to prove medical negligence, referencing the Bolam test and its criticisms. It emphasized that Consumer Fora should not mechanically require expert evidence in all medical negligence cases and should judge each case on its own facts. The court also noted that the Evidence Act does not strictly apply to consumer cases, and principles of natural justice should be followed, citing Malay Kumar Ganguly vs. Dr. Sukumar Mukherjee.",Not available in document

Fernandes alleged medical negligence by Dr. Shrikhande for leaving gauze in her abdomen during a 1993 surgery, leading to a second surgery in 2002. The core issue is whether the complaint, filed in 2004, was barred by the limitation period under the Consumer Protection Act.","The court analyzed Sections 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, and 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, focusing on the limitation period for filing complaints. The court considered precedents regarding the accrual of cause of action and the 'Discovery Rule'. The key legal question was whether the discovery of the gauze in 2002 constituted a fresh cause of action, restarting the limitation period, or if the limitation period began from the initial surgery in 1993.",Not available in document

Bench. The said order reads as under:
""The questions in this ca","Ethiopian Airlines appealed a National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission order regarding a complaint filed by Ganesh Narain Saboo. Saboo alleged that Ethiopian Airlines caused a delay in delivering a consignment of Reactive Dyes, leading to deterioration of the goods. The core dispute revolves around whether a foreign state or its instrumentality can be proceeded against under the Consumer Protection Act without prior permission from the Central Government.","The court considered Section 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) regarding sovereign immunity and its applicability to proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The appellant argued that prior permission from the Central Government is required to sue a foreign state. The court also examined precedents like Mirza Ali Akbar Kashani v.

Ibrahim sustained serious injuries in a motor vehicle accident involving a tempo driven by Raju, and claimed compensation for medical expenses, pain, suffering, and loss of future earnings. The National Insurance Company contested the claim, alleging the accident was not due to the driver's negligence.","The judgment discusses principles for determining just compensation in motor accident cases under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It cites precedents like *Ward v. James*, *R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd.*, *Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth S.

the High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant, challenging the Notification dated
28.5.2008, by which on the date of reconstitution of the U.P","J.S. Yadav, the appellant, challenged a notification declaring that he ceased to hold office as a Member of the U.P. State Human Rights Commission. He argued that his five-year tenure, which began before amendments to The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, could not be curtailed by the amendments. The State of U.P. argued that the appellant suffered a disability by virtue of the amended law and ceased to be competent to hold the post.","The court analyzed Sections 21, 23, 25, and 26 of The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, as amended in 2006, along with Article 236(a) of the Constitution of India and Section 3(17) of the General Clauses Act, 1897. The court interpreted that the experience of an Additional District Judge could not be considered equivalent to that of a District Judge for eligibility under the amended Act. The court also held that the cadre of District Judge and Additional District Judge are not interchangeable or inter-transferable.",Not available in document

   ","K.N. Govindan Kutty Menon filed a complaint against C.D. Shaji under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for a dishonored cheque. The Magistrate referred the case to Lok Adalat, where a settlement was reached, and an award was passed. The dispute arose when Shaji failed to adhere to the payment schedule outlined in the award, and Menon sought execution of the award as a decree of a civil court.","The central issue was the interpretation of Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, specifically whether an award passed by Lok Adalat in a criminal case referred by a Magistrate can be considered a decree of a civil court and thus executable. The court analyzed the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, the definition of 'Court' and 'legal service', and Section 21, which deems the award of Lok Adalat to be a decree of a civil court. The court also referred to precedents from Bombay High Court and Madras High Court.",Not available in document

2. The appellant, an aviation company operating an air carrier under the name and style of IndiGo
Airlines has filed this appeal aggrieved by the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated
31.12.200","InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. (IndiGo Airlines) appealed against the Andhra Pradesh High Court's decision, which upheld the Permanent Lok Adalat's award of compensation to N.Satchidanand. The dispute arose from a significant delay and subsequent cancellation of an IndiGo flight due to dense fog, leading to the passenger's confinement on the aircraft for an extended period and alleged deficiency in service. The main grievance includes lack of adequate food and facilities, and alleged wrongful detention at the destination airport.","The judgment primarily focuses on the deficiency in service provided by the airline, particularly concerning the inconvenience caused to the passenger due to the prolonged delay and confinement. While the judgment acknowledges the delay was due to circumstances beyond the airline's control (bad weather), it emphasizes the airline's moral duty to provide adequate care and comfort to passengers during the delay. The High Court adopted a liberal approach to the jurisdiction clause in the contract of carriage, favoring consumer protection. Specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act or precedents are not explicitly cited in the provided text.","The Supreme Court appeal was against the Andhra Pradesh High Court's dismissal of Interglobe Aviation Ltd's writ petition. The document is truncated, so the final outcome of the Supreme Court appeal (allowed or dismissed) is not available in the provided text."

1. These appeals emanate from the order dated 16.11.2005 in Revision Petition No.551 of 2005 and
order dated 12.7.2001 in Miscellaneous Petition No.1 of 2001 in Original Petition No.110 of 1993
passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi.
2. The main question which arises for consideration is whether the District Consumer Forums and
the State Commissions have the power to set aside their own ex parte orders or in other words have
the power to recall or review their own","This case involves appeals against orders passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission regarding the power of District Consumer Forums and State Commissions to set aside their own ex parte orders. In Civil Appeal No. 4307 of 2007, the complainant alleged deficiency in service by Ashirwad Nursing Home after the death of Smita Achyut Karekar following a surgery, claiming compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/-. The State Commission recalled its order dismissing the complaint for want of prosecution, which was challenged before the National Commission.","The court analyzed various sections of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, including Sections 13(4), 17, 22, and 22A, along with Regulation 26(1) of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005. The court considered conflicting precedents, specifically Jyotsana Arvind Kumar Shah & Others v. Bombay Hospital Trust and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. R. Srinivasan, regarding the power of State Commissions to review or recall ex parte orders. The court ultimately determined that the Consumer Protection Act does not explicitly grant State Commissions the power to review or recall their own orders, unlike the specific power granted to the National Commission under Section 22(2) and 22A.",Not available in document

National Cons","Rubi (Chandra) Dutta, the owner of a bus, filed a claim with United India Insurance Co. Ltd. after her bus was damaged in an accident. The insurance company repudiated the claim, alleging the driver did not have a valid license. The dispute centers on whether the driver possessed a valid driving license at the time of the accident, impacting the insurance claim under the policy.","The court analyzed Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding the revisional powers of the National Commission, emphasizing that such powers should only be exercised if there is a prima facie jurisdictional error in the impugned order. The court found that the National Commission transgressed its jurisdiction by re-interpreting the facts and setting aside the concurrent findings of the lower fora without any jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice. The court relied on the evidence presented by the RTO official and surveyor reports to determine the validity of the driver's license.","The appeal was allowed, and the National Commission's order was set aside, implying that the concurrent findings of the District Forum and State Commission are reinstated. The document does not explicitly state the exact relief granted, but it suggests the insurance company is liable to pay the assessed damages."

The appellant sought increased compensation for grievous injuries, including head trauma and paralysis, caused by the rash and negligent driving of a truck. The dispute centers on the adequacy of the compensation awarded for medical expenses, loss of earnings, pain and suffering, and diminished marriage prospects.","The judgment references Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, under which the initial claim was filed. The court relies on precedents like R. D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) Private Limited, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth S. Dhananka, Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan, Arvind Kumar Mishra v. New India Assurance Company Limited, and Raj Kumar vs. Ajay Kumar to establish principles for determining just compensation in accident cases, considering both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. The court emphasizes the need for objective assessment, fair compensation, and consideration of factors like loss of earnings, medical expenses, pain and suffering, and loss of amenities.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and enhanced the compensation awarded to the appellant. The court remitted the matter to the High Court for re-determination of the compensation amount based on the principles outlined in the judgment, specifically directing consideration of future prospects and a more realistic assessment of disability and its impact on earning capacity."

Respondent No.1 is a garment exporter and re","Trans Mediterranean Airways, an international cargo carrier, appealed against an order by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directing them to pay compensation to M/s Universal Exports, a garment exporter, for deficiency of service. The dispute arose from the alleged misdelivery of a garment consignment shipped to Spain, with the consignor claiming the carrier delivered the goods to the wrong party. The core issue was whether the Consumer Protection Act (CP Act) had jurisdiction over the matter, considering the provisions of the Carriage by Air Act (CA Act) and the Warsaw Convention.","The court examined the interplay between the CP Act, CA Act, and the Warsaw Convention, focusing on whether the National Commission had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. The appellant argued that Rule 29 of the Second Schedule to the CA Act limited jurisdiction to specific courts, excluding the National Commission. The court considered Section 3 of the CP Act, which states that Consumer Courts are additional Forums, and the procedural law of the country in which the suit is filed, which in India is the CP Act.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome of the appeal. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed."

Ushodaya Enterprises claimed that Venugopal's use of 'Eenadu' infringed on their copyright and goodwill, despite the businesses being unrelated. The core dispute revolves around whether Venugopal's use of the common word 'Eenadu' constitutes trademark infringement or passing-off.","The judgment primarily focuses on the principles of passing-off and dilution of trademarks, referencing the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 and the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The court considered arguments regarding the likelihood of confusion, the distinctiveness of the mark 'Eenadu', and whether it had acquired a secondary meaning. The case law on dilution, particularly the Benz case (Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft v. Hybo Hindustan), was discussed in relation to the distinctiveness required for trademark protection across different product categories.",Not available in document

Dubey, a former High Court Judge who later served as President of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The dispute centered on whether Dubey's service as President of the State Commission could be counted towards pensionable service, in addition to his service as a High Court Judge. The core issue revolves around pension benefits for service rendered as President of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.","The court analyzed the High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954, and the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, along with relevant rules and precedents, including Justice P. Venugopal v. Union of India. The court determined that the services as a High Court Judge and President of the State Commission could not be clubbed for pension calculation, as the 1954 Act is a self-contained code and does not contemplate granting pension to a retired High Court Judge for holding any other office of profit. The court considered arguments regarding the executive power of the state to issue orders when rules are silent but ultimately focused on the statutory framework governing judicial pensions.",Not available in document

raised challenge to the vires of Sections 22-A, 22-B, 22-C, 22-D and 22-E of the Legal Services
Authorities Act, 1987 (for short, ‘1987 Act’) as inserted by the Legal Services Authorities
Bar Council Of India vs Union Of India on 3 August, 2012
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/563289","The Bar Council of India filed a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of Sections 22-A, 22-B, 22-C, 22-D, and 22-E of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, as amended in 2002. The petitioner argued that these sections, which pertain to Permanent Lok Adalats, are arbitrary, violate Article 14 of the Constitution, and deny fair justice, particularly concerning public utility services and consumer rights. The grievance centers around the potential for public utility service providers to preempt consumers from accessing consumer forums or other judicial processes.","The petitioner argued that Section 22-C(1) read with Section 22-C(2) allows public utility service providers to unilaterally bring disputes before Permanent Lok Adalats, preventing consumers from seeking redressal in consumer forums. They contended that Section 22-C(8) prevents courts and consumer fora from examining deficiencies in services and that Section 22-E(1) and (4) make the award of the Permanent Lok Adalat final and binding without a right to appeal. The petitioner cited precedents like *The Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Kamlekar Shantaram Wadke of Bombay and Others* and several cases related to the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the jurisdiction of consumer forums cannot be ousted by Permanent Lok Adalats.",Not available in document

1. These special leave petitions have been filed against the impugned judgments and orders dated
16.9.2008 in Writ Appeal No. 2518 of 2007 and 17.12.2009 in Review Petition No. 380 of 2009. In
order to decide the controversy it is not necessary to make the reference to the factual controversy
involved herein.
The basic issue has been raised in the petitions that the Kerala High Court did not have jurisdiction
to entertain the writ petition against the judgment and order passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter called ‘the Commission’). The said order could be
challenged only before this Court in view of the provisions of National Consumer Protection Act,
1986, thus, the order passed by the High ","Cicily Kallarackal filed a special leave petition against Vehicle Factory challenging the Kerala High Court's jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition against an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The petitioner argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction as the National Consumer Protection Act, 1986, stipulates that such orders can only be challenged before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court acknowledged that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the writ petition against the Commission's order, citing the statutory appeal process under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The court referenced Mohammad Swalleh & Ors. v. IIIrd All. District Judge, Meerut & Anr., AIR 1988 SC 94, to highlight that an order passed by a court lacking jurisdiction need not always be set aside if justice has been served. The court also referred to Anshulal Aggarwal v. NOIDA, (2011) CPJ 63 (SC) regarding condonation of delay in cases under the Consumer Protection Act.","The special leave petitions were dismissed due to an inordinate and unexplained delay in filing them, with the court emphasizing that condoning such delay would effectively substitute the legislature's prescribed limitation period. The court cautioned High Courts against entertaining writ petitions against orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, emphasizing that statutory appeals should be directed to the Supreme Court."

Court of Bombay at Aurangabad vide which the High Court declined to interfere with the order
dated 26th February, 2008 passed by the State Information Commissioner under the provisions of
the Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short ‘the Act’).
3. We may notice the facts in brief giving rise to the present appeal. One Shri Ram Narayan,
respondent No.2, a political person belonging to the Nationalist Congress Party, Nanded filed an
application on 3rd January, 2007, before the appellant who was a nominated authority under
Section 5 of the Act and was responsible for providing the information sought by the applicants.
This application was moved under Section 6(1) of the Act.
4. In the application, the said respondent ","Manohar, a Public Information Officer in the State Excise Department, is appealing a decision by the State Information Commission directing disciplinary action against him for allegedly delaying information requested by Respondent No. 2, a political person, under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The information sought related to the appointment and caste verification of individuals selected through reservation categories in the department. The appellant argues that he acted on the application promptly and was later transferred, and that the Commission's order violated natural justice principles.","The primary controversy revolves around the interpretation of Section 20 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, which deals with penalties and disciplinary action against Public Information Officers for failing to provide information. The court emphasizes that State Information Commissions exercise quasi-judicial powers and must adhere to the principles of natural justice. The court notes that the order does not satisfy the ingredients of Section 20(2) of the Act.",Not available in document

(NSCL) appealed against orders of consumer forums awarding compensation to farmers (respondents) for losses suffered due to defective seeds sold by NSCL, resulting in crop failure or reduced yield. The farmers alleged that the seeds purchased from NSCL were defective, leading to financial losses. The product involved is seeds for various crops like sunflower and bitter gourd.","The appellant argued that the Seeds Act, 1966, governs seed quality issues, precluding claims under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and that the District Forums failed to adhere to Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act. They also contended that seed growers are not 'consumers' as they purchased seeds for commercial purposes. The National Commission rejected the argument that the Seeds Act was the only remedy, noting it lacked provisions for compensating farmers for losses due to defective seeds.","The appeals filed by National Seeds Corporation Ltd were related to the dismissal of their appeals and revisions against the orders of the District Consumer Forums, State Commission, and National Commission, which had awarded compensation to the farmers.

1. The value of any freedom is determined by the extent to which the citizens are able to enjoy such
freedom. Ours is a constitutional democracy and it is axiomatic that citizens have the right to know
about the affairs of the Government which, having been elected by them, seeks to formulate some
policies of governance aimed at their welfare. However, like any other freedom, this freedom also
has limitations. It is a settled proposition that the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression
enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India","Namit Sharma, a public-spirited citizen, filed a writ petition against the Union of India challenging the constitutional validity of Sections 12(5), 12(6), 15(5), and 15(6) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. The petitioner argued that the eligibility criteria for appointing Chief Information Commissioners and Information Commissioners were vague, arbitrary, and lacked judicial expertise, violating Articles 14, 16, and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The core grievance was that the lack of specific qualifications and judicial experience in the selection process would undermine the effective administration of justice under the Act.","The court discussed the power of judicial review and the grounds for declaring a law unconstitutional, including contravention of fundamental rights, legislative competence, and violation of constitutional provisions. The petitioner contended that the absence of specific qualifications and the vague terminology used in Sections 12(5) and 15(5) of the RTI Act led to arbitrariness and violated the principles of equality before the law. The petitioner cited precedents like Union of India v. Madras Bar Association and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India to support the argument that judicial or quasi-judicial bodies should have members with judicial experience.",Not available in document

1. An interesting question of law as to the ambit and scope of Section 22 of the S","Raheja Universal Limited (Appellant) and NRC Limited (Respondent) are in dispute over a land sale agreement. Raheja Universal sought to purchase land from NRC Limited, but disagreements arose regarding payment installments after NRC Limited faced financial difficulties and was declared a sick industrial company. The core issue revolves around the applicability of Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, and its potential override of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.","The court considered the scope of Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, in relation to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, specifically Sections 53A and 54. The central question was whether Section 22 could override the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act in the context of the existing agreement. The AAIFR held that Section 22A would not apply to an agreement for sale already entered into, registered, acted upon and in the process of completion.",Not available in document

Selection Committee had not complied with sub-section (5) o","Rajesh Awasthi's appointment as Chairperson of the U.P. State Electricity Regulatory Commission was challenged by Nand Lal Jaiswal via a writ of quo warranto. The grievance was that the Selection Committee did not comply with Section 85(5) of the Electricity Act, 2003, and that Awasthi had a conflict of interest due to his previous employment with J.P. Power Ventures Ltd.","The court analyzed Section 85 of the Electricity Act, 2003, particularly sub-section (5), which requires the Selection Committee to ensure that appointees do not have financial or other interests that could prejudicially affect their functions. The High Court found that the Selection Committee failed to comply with this provision by delegating the responsibility to the State Government. The Supreme Court considered arguments regarding substantial compliance and curable defects but ultimately focused on the proper interpretation and application of Section 85(5).",Not available in document

Ltd. and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Limited (Saharas) appealed against the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regarding the issuance of Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs). SEBI questioned whether the OFCDs issued by Saharas should have been listed on a recognized stock exchange and whether they violated SEBI guidelines and regulations, alleging large-scale collection of money from the public through OFCDs.","The case primarily concerns the powers of SEBI under Section 55A(b) of the Companies Act, 1956, to administer provisions related to the issue and transfer of securities to the public by listed companies or companies intending to get listed. The court examined whether the OFCDs issued by the appellants should have been listed under Section 73 read with Section 60B of the Companies Act and whether they violated the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.

the said section throughout this judgment, the same is extracted hereinbelow :

The dispute concerns whether the Copyright Board has the power to grant interim compulsory licenses under Section 31 of the Copyright Act, 1957, specifically regarding the broadcasting of copyrighted music by Music Broadcast Pvt. Ltd. (MBPL). Super Cassettes argued the Copyright Board, being a creature of statute, only possesses powers explicitly granted to it.","The court analyzed Section 31 of the Copyright Act, 1957, and considered precedents regarding the powers of tribunals created by statute, including cases related to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The appellant argued that the Copyright Board, lacking express statutory empowerment, cannot grant interim compulsory licenses.

The central dispute revolves around the interpretation of Sections 30 and 31 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007, specifically whether an appeal can be filed directly to the Supreme Court without following the procedure outlined in Section 31.","The court analyzed Sections 30 and 31 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007, emphasizing that Section 30 is ""subject to"" Section 31. The court interpreted this to mean that appeals to the Supreme Court against decisions of the Armed Forces Tribunal are not a matter of right, except in cases of contempt, and require either a certificate from the Tribunal or leave from the Supreme Court. The court cited several precedents to interpret the phrase ""subject to"", concluding it makes Section 30 subordinate to Section 31.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome or decision of the court regarding the appeals. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed."

                        ","Dr. Kunal Saha filed a consumer complaint against several doctors and AMRI Hospital, alleging medical negligence in the treatment of his wife, Anuradha Saha, which led to her death. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) found the doctors and hospital negligent and awarded compensation. Multiple appeals were filed by the doctors, the hospital, and Dr. Saha, challenging the quantum of compensation and the apportionment of liability.","The judgment primarily focuses on the assessment of damages and the evidence presented to support the claim for compensation, particularly regarding the deceased's income. It discusses the onus of proof on the claimant to provide cogent evidence of income, including salary slips, tax returns, and appointment letters. The judgment also considers the deduction of personal living expenses and taxes from the annual income to determine the appropriate compensation amount. Specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act are not explicitly mentioned, but the case revolves around the principles of determining fair and just compensation for medical negligence under the Act.",The document does not provide the final outcome of the appeals. It only details the arguments presented by the various parties regarding the quantum of compensation awarded by the National Commission.

Air India Limited was constituted under the Air Corporations Act, 1953. By virtue of Section 3 of the
Air Corporations (Transfer of Undertakings and Repeal) Act, 1994, Air India has vested in Indian
Airlines Limited. It has Ground Services Department at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi.
Respondent No. 2 is Hotel Corporation of India, which is a Government Company incorporated
under the Companies Act. The authorized share capital of the Hotel Corporation of India,
hereinafter referred to as the Corporation, is Rupees 10 crores, divided into 10 lakhs equity shares of
Rs. 100/- each. The Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India and its entire share
capital is held by Air India and its nominee. Excepting 6 shares, 4,99,994 shares","The case involves a dispute between Balwant Rai Saluja & Anr (the Appellants/workmen) and Air India Ltd. & Ors (the Respondents). The workmen, employed in the Air India Ground Services Department Canteen through Chef Air (a unit of Hotel Corporation of India), claimed to be deemed employees of Air India and sought regularization of their services. Their grievance stemmed from being employed on a casual basis with artificial breaks in service and being denied the rights of regular employees.","The judgment primarily revolves around determining the employer-employee relationship between the workmen and Air India, considering the involvement of Hotel Corporation of India (HCI) and Chef Air. The court examined the extent of Air India's control over HCI and the canteen operations, as well as the nature of the canteen (statutory or not). The court considered various precedents regarding the lifting of the corporate veil and the determination of true employer-employee relationships in cases involving contract labor, but ultimately found that the workmen were not employees of Air India.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the workmen were not employees of Air India and thus not entitled to regularization."

Leave granted in bo","This case involves appeals against a High Court order that quashed the appointment of Respondent No. 5 as CEO of the Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha (CESU) and directed recovery of honorarium paid to him. The dispute arose from a public interest litigation challenging the appointment, arguing it violated service regulations and was a misuse of public funds. The service involved is electricity distribution.","The document primarily focuses on the legality of the appointment of the Chairman as CEO and the associated honorarium, examining the Orissa Electricity Act, 2003 and related schemes and regulations. It discusses whether the appointment violated statutory provisions and service regulations, particularly concerning the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and CEO.

1. All the above-mentioned appeals have be","Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC), an insurer, appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order regarding claims filed by M/s Garg Sons International, an exporter, for non-payment by a foreign buyer. ECGC rejected the claims based on the exporter's alleged failure to comply with the policy's clause requiring timely notification of payment defaults. The dispute centers on whether the exporter adhered to the insurance policy's terms regarding declaration of overdue payments.","The court emphasized that insurance contracts must be strictly construed, giving paramount importance to the words used and avoiding any addition, deletion, or substitution of terms. Citing several precedents, including *M/s. Suraj Mal Ram Niwas Oil Mills (P) Ltd. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.* and *Vikram Greentech (I) Ltd. & Anr. v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.*, the court held that it's not permissible to substitute contract terms under the guise of interpretation and that the rule of *contra proferentem* does not apply to commercial contracts. The court interpreted Clause 8(b) of the insurance policy, requiring timely declaration of overdue payments, as a condition precedent for the insurer's liability.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals related to two claims (Civil Appeal Nos. 1547 and 1557 of 2004) where the exporter had complied with the policy terms, and disallowed the remaining claims due to the exporter's failure to provide timely notification of payment defaults."

2. The appellant herein had agreed to sell a plot of land to the respondent by virtue of an agreement
entered into with him on 2nd August, 1999. Inasmuch as the appellant failed to hand over the
possession of the concerned plot of land, the respondent filed a complaint, bearing No.62 of 2000,
before the District Consumer Redressal Forum at Wardha. The appellant had raised the contention
that the Consumer Forum had no jurisdiction to try the matter and a claim for specific performance
of the agreement would lie only before the Civil Court and not before the District Consumer
Redressal Forum. The District Forum, however, in its order dated 10.10.2000 took the view that no
civil dispute was involved, and that it was a case of deficiency in rendering service to the respondent.
The District Forum therefore passed an order directing the","Ganeshlal (appellant) agreed to sell a plot of land to Shyam (respondent) but failed to hand over possession. Shyam filed a complaint with the District Consumer Redressal Forum alleging deficiency in service. Ganeshlal argued that the Consumer Forum lacked jurisdiction, as the dispute concerned specific performance of a land sale agreement, which should be addressed in a civil court.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(c) defining a 'complaint' and Section 2(1)(g) defining 'deficiency' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The court stated that a simple land sale dispute doesn't fall under the Act's purview, as 'deficiency' relates to faults in the quality, nature, or manner of service performance. While 'housing construction' is covered as a service due to a 1993 amendment, a simple land sale is not.","Although the court agreed with the appellant's legal argument regarding jurisdiction, the appeal was disposed of without granting any relief because the appellant had already executed the sale deed and handed over the land to the respondent after the State Commission's order."

2. Shyam Kapoor, the respondent herein, preferred a complaint before the District Consumer Forum
IInd, Lucknow (hereinafter referred to as the ‘District Forum’), asserting that he had deposited a
sum of Rs.5,000/- with the Lucknow Development Authority, i.e., the appellant herein, on
1.12.1982. The aforesaid deposit had been made for allotment of a 6,000 sq. ft. plot in the ‘A’
category under the Gomti Nagar Residential Scheme (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Scheme’). It was
alleged, that the Lucknow Development Authority had neither allotted any plot to the
respondent-complainant, nor returned the deposit tendered by him. The appellant herein, however,
issued a press notice in 1991 requiring persons similarly situated as the respondent-complainant,","Shyam Kapoor filed a complaint against the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) for failing to allot him a plot of land under the Gomti Nagar Residential Scheme despite depositing the required amounts in 1982 and 1992. The LDA raised objections including limitation, jurisdiction, and change of registration. The District Forum ruled in favor of Kapoor, directing the LDA to allot a plot, but the LDA's subsequent appeal and revision petition were dismissed.","The Supreme Court referred to Rajeev Hitendra Pathak & Ors. v. Achyut Kashinath Karekar & Anr., (2011) 9 SCC 541, to establish that the State Commission lacked the power to review its ex parte orders, justifying the appellant's decision to approach the National Commission. However, the Court upheld the National Commission's dismissal of the revision petition due to the significant delay in filing, finding no valid justification for condoning the delay.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the National Commission's decision, but set aside the costs imposed on the Lucknow Development Authority, acknowledging that their choice to approach the National Commission was not frivolous."

                    CIVIL  APPEAL NO.   8688   ","M/s Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) was engaged in property development and entered into agreements with landowners and prospective purchasers for the construction of apartment complexes. The dispute arose regarding the applicability of sales tax on the transfer of goods involved in the execution of these construction contracts, specifically whether these transactions constituted 'works contracts' under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 and the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002.","The primary legal question was whether the ratio laid down in Raheja Development Corporation case was correct, and whether development agreements could be considered 'works contracts' subject to sales tax. The court examined the definition of 'works contract' under the relevant state laws and considered whether the transfer of property in goods during construction fell within the ambit of taxable sales. The Bombay High Court considered the constitutional validity of Section 2(24) of the Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002.","Leave was granted in all special leave petitions. The court needed to determine if the two-Judge Bench decision in Raheja Development laid down the correct legal position, and the matter was referred to a larger bench for consideration."

1. This appeal under Section 130-E of the Customs Act, 1962 (for short “the Act”) arises from the
final Order No. 142/03-B dated 18.02.2003, passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control)
Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short “the Tribunal”). By the impugned order, the Tribunal has
upheld the levy of customs duty on the import of furnace oil as also the penalty under Section 112 of
the Act, rejecting the plea of the appellant that demand of the duty along with the penalty was
barred by limitation.
2. The appellant, an Export Oriented Unit (for short “EOU”), is engaged in the manufacture of all
wool and poly-wool worst","M/S. Uniworth Textiles Ltd., an Export Oriented Unit (EOU), appealed against the levy of customs duty on imported furnace oil and a penalty imposed under Section 112 of the Customs Act, 1962. The dispute arose because Uniworth Textiles procured duty-free furnace oil for the captive power plant of its sister unit, Uniworth Ltd., and the customs authorities demanded duty, claiming the exemption was not applicable. The main grievance was that the demand was time-barred under Section 28 of the Customs Act.","The court analyzed Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962, which imposes a limitation period of six months for demanding unpaid duties, extendable to five years only in cases of collusion, willful misstatement, or suppression of facts. The court found that mere non-payment of duties does not automatically equate to collusion or willful misstatement. The court determined that the revenue could not prove collusion or willful misstatement, therefore the extended limitation period did not apply.",Not available in document

1. India’s capital market in the recent times has witnessed tremendous growth, characterized
particularly by increasing participation of public. Investors’ confidence in the capital market can be
sustained largely by ensuring investors’ protection. Disclosure and transparency are the two pillars
on which market integrity rests. Facts of the case disclose how the investors’ confidence has been
eroded and how the market has been abused for personal gains and attainments.
2. The Appellate Jurisdiction of this Court guaranteed under Section 15Z of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short ‘SEBI Act’) has been invoked challenging a joint order
dated 5.10.2012 passed in Appeal Nos. 28 and 29 of 2012 passed by Securities Appellate Tribunal,
Mu","N. Narayanan, the appellant, challenged an order by SEBI restraining him from dealing in securities and imposing a monetary penalty for violating the SEBI Act and Regulations. The dispute arose from irregularities in the financial statements of Pyramid Saimira Theatre Limited (PSTL), where Narayanan was a director, which allegedly inflated profits and misled investors. The core grievance is that the company manipulated accounts and made false disclosures to the stock exchange.","The court considered Section 15Z of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, and Section 15HA of the same act, along with Regulations 3 and 4 of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practice Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. The court emphasized the importance of investor protection and market integrity, highlighting that disclosure and transparency are crucial pillars. The judgment focuses on preventing ""market abuse"" and upholding the objectives of the SEBI Act.",The judgment text does not explicitly state the final outcome of the appeal. It describes the background and legal issues but does not include a concluding statement about whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed.

2. In this appeal, the appellant challenges the final judgment and order dated 20th April, 2012
passed by the Delhi High Court in L.P.A. No. 22/2012. In the said order, the Division Bench
dismissed the appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge dated 8th December, 2011,
wherein the Single Judge held that “the information sought by the appellant herein is the third party
information wherein third party may plead a privacy defence and the proper question would be as to
whether divulging of such an information is in the public interest or not.” Thus, the matter has been
remitted back to Chief Information Commissioner to consider the issue after following the
procedure under Section 11 of the Right to Information Act.
3. The factual matrix of the case is as follows:
The appellant filed an application to Central Public I","R.K. Jain filed an application under the Right to Information Act seeking copies of note sheets and correspondence related to Ms. Jyoti Balasundram, a Member of CESTAT. The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) denied the information, citing Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, arguing it related to personal information and would cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The appellant challenged this denial through appeals and writ petitions, ultimately reaching the Supreme Court.","The court analyzed Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, which exempts disclosure of personal information unless it has a relationship to public activity or interest, or if larger public interest justifies disclosure. It also considered Section 11 regarding third-party information and the procedure for disclosing such information, including notice to the third party. The court referenced the Girish Ramchandra Deshpande case and distinguished State of U.P. vs. Raj Narain, ultimately concluding that the information sought was related to the ACR of a public servant and fell under the exemption unless a larger public interest outweighed the privacy concerns.","The Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court's decision, which had dismissed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the Chief Information Commissioner to consider whether larger public interest justifies the disclosure of the information after following the procedure under Section 11 of the RTI Act."

important question of law arises for our decision: whether the High Court in exerc",The State of Punjab appealed against a judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which directed the State to follow a specific procedure for the selection and appointment of the Chairman of the State Public Service Commission. The High Court also quashed the appointment of Mr. Harish Dhanda as Chairman. The dispute centers on whether the High Court has the jurisdiction to lay down such procedures and quash appointments under Article 226 of the Constitution.,"The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of Article 316 of the Constitution, which deals with the appointment of Chairman and Members of the Public Service Commission. The appellant argued that Article 316 grants discretion to the State Government in these appointments and that the High Court's intervention violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The judgment also references Article 163(3) regarding the confidentiality of advice tendered by the Chief Minister to the Governor.",Not available in document

2. The right of the victim of a road accident to claim compensation is a statutory one. The
Parliament in its wisdom inserted the re","The case involves S. Iyyapan (appellant) and M/S United India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr (respondents). The dispute arose from a road accident where the deceased, Charles, was hit by a Mahindra van. The insurance company disowned liability, arguing that the driver of the van had a license to drive a light motor vehicle but lacked the endorsement to drive it as a commercial vehicle.","The court considered Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which outlines the insurer's liability to satisfy judgments against insured persons regarding third-party risks. The insurance company argued a breach of policy condition, citing precedents like *New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Prabhu Lal* and *Sardari & Ors. v. Sushil Kumar & Ors.*, claiming a light motor vehicle license doesn't authorize driving a commercial vehicle. The court also considered precedents arguing the opposite. The High Court sided with the insurance company.","The High Court ruled in favor of the insurance company, stating they were not liable to pay compensation because the driver lacked the appropriate license for a commercial vehicle. The owner of the vehicle was deemed solely liable for the compensation."

These","The Union of India filed a review petition against the judgment in Writ Petition (C) No. 210 of 2012, which was initiated by Namit Sharma. The dispute concerned the constitutional validity of Sections 12(5), 12(6), 15(5), and 15(6) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, specifically regarding the eligibility criteria for appointing Central and State Information Commissioners. The respondent argued that these provisions were vague, lacked nexus with the Act's object, and violated Article 14 of the Constitution.","The court analyzed Sections 12(5) and 15(5) of the Right to Information Act, holding that the 'knowledge and experience' requirement implies a basic degree in the respective field. It interpreted Sections 12(6) and 15(6) to mean that disqualifications like holding an office of profit or being connected to a political party apply *after* appointment as Chief Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner. The court relied on precedents like Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi v. Employees of Bharat Bank & Ors. and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and Others to emphasize the quasi-judicial nature of the Information Commission and the need for judicial independence.","The writ petition was partly allowed, with the court upholding the constitutional validity of Sections 12(5) and 15(5) while providing a specific interpretation, and clarifying the application of Sections 12(6) and 15(6) as conditions precedent to appointment. The court also directed the government to frame rules to make the working of the Information Commissions effective and in consonance with the rule of law."

1. In view of the difference of opinion by two learned Judges, and by referral order dated 13.11.2013
of this Court, these Civil Appeals are placed before us for our consideration and decision. The
question before this bench is whether the workmen engaged in statutory canteens, through a
contractor, could be treated as employees of the principal establishment.
Balwant Rai Saluja & Anr Etc.Etc vs Air India Ltd.& Ors on 25 August, 2014
Indian Kan","The case involves a dispute between Balwant Rai Saluja & Anr (workmen) and Air India Ltd. & Ors regarding whether the workmen engaged in statutory canteens through a contractor (HCI) can be treated as employees of the principal establishment (Air India). The workmen claim they are deemed employees of Air India because the canteen is maintained due to a statutory obligation under the Factories Act, 1948.","The court considered Section 46 of the Factories Act, 1948, which mandates canteens in factories with over 250 workers, and Rules 65-70 of the Delhi Factory Rules, 1950, applicable to Air India. The central question was whether the statutory obligation automatically makes canteen workers employees of the principal employer, irrespective of an intermediary. The court also examined the degree of control exercised by Air India over the canteen operations and the contractor, HCI, and whether HCI was a mere camouflage.",Not available in document

1. The petitioner-wife Dipanwita ","This case involves a dispute between Dipanwita Roy (wife) and Ronobroto Roy (husband) arising from a petition filed by the husband seeking dissolution of their marriage under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, based on allegations of the wife's adulterous lifestyle and the paternity of a child. The husband sought a DNA test to prove the child was not his, which the wife contested. The core issue revolves around the legitimacy of the child born during the marriage and the admissibility of a DNA test to determine paternity.","The Supreme Court considered Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, which provides conclusive proof of legitimacy for a child born during a valid marriage unless there was no access between the parties. The Court also analyzed previous judgments regarding the interpretation of 'access' and the circumstances under which a DNA test can be ordered, balancing the need for evidence with the right to privacy and protection against unwarranted aspersions on legitimacy. The Court emphasized that ordering a DNA test should not be a routine matter and should only be done when there is a strong prima facie case and other evidence is insufficient.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the wife, setting aside the High Court's order for a DNA test. The Court held that the High Court erred in directing the DNA test without sufficient justification and in disregarding the provisions of Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act."

2. This appeal has been preferred by the appellant-Durgapur Casual Workers Union and others
(hereinafter referred to as, 'the workmen' for short) against the judgment and order dated 25th
February, 2009 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta in F.M.A. No.2345 of
2005 (C.A.N. 8685 of 2007 and C.A.N.4726 of 2008). By the impugned judgment, the High Court
allowed th","Durgapur Casual Workers Union appealed against the Food Corporation of India (FCI) regarding the regularization of 49 casual workmen. The workmen were initially employed as contract laborers and later as casual employees by the FCI. The dispute arose after the FCI refused to absorb them as permanent employees, leading to a reference to the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, which ruled in favor of the workmen, a decision later overturned by the High Court.","The court analyzed the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, specifically Sections 2(j), 2(k), 2(ka), and 2(ra) concerning the definition of 'industry,' 'industrial dispute,' 'industrial establishment,' and 'unfair labor practice.' The court also considered the applicability of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India regarding equality in public employment, citing the precedent set in Secretary, State of Karnataka and others v. Umadevi (3) and others, (2006) 4 SCC 1. The court determined that regularization cannot violate the principles of Articles 14 and 16.","The appeal was against the High Court's decision to set aside the Tribunal's award. The Supreme Court had to determine if the initial appointment's validity could be raised without specific pleading and if the workmen were entitled to absorption given the unfair labor practice finding. The document is truncated, so the final outcome is not available."

Petition Nos.3349 of 2006 and 2858 of 2008.

complaint and without","General Motors (India) Private Limited appealed against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) regarding unfair trade practices. The complainant, Ashok Ramnik Lal Tolat, alleged that General Motors misrepresented their Chevrolet Forester as an SUV suitable for all terrains, leading him to purchase it based on this false advertising. He sought a refund and compensation after discovering the vehicle was not as advertised.","The National Commission referred to Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which defines ""unfair trade practice."" The court affirmed the finding of unfair trade practice based on the misleading representations in General Motors' brochures and advertisements, concluding that the vehicle was not a SUV as claimed. However, the court found that the National Commission erred in awarding punitive damages as there was no specific claim for it in the original complaint.",The Supreme Court upheld the finding of unfair trade practice but set aside the portion of the NCDRC order awarding punitive damages. The court upheld the order directing General Motors to refund a portion of the vehicle's price to the complainant upon return of the vehicle.

The petitioner contended that the NTT, styled as a quasi-judicial appellate tribunal, unconstitutionally substituted High Courts in adjudicating appeals arising from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals under various tax laws. The core grievance was that the NTT's constitution undermined the independence and fairness essential for an adjudicatory authority.","The judgment analyzes the historical evolution of income tax and customs legislation in India, focusing on the appellate remedies available under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Customs Act, 1962.

The dispute arose from a dishonored cheque, and the settlement reached in Lok Adalat was not approved due to non-compliance with the deposit requirements outlined in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H.","The appeal concerned whether the guidelines in Damodar S. Prabhu, requiring a deposit of a percentage of the cheque amount for compounding offences, apply to settlements reached in Lok Adalats under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. The appellant argued that these guidelines contradict the purpose of Lok Adalats, which aim for amicable dispute resolution.

Garg is","M/s. Bhagwati Vanaspati Traders, a proprietorship concern, purchased a National Savings Certificate (NSC) that matured in 2001. The Post Office refused to pay the maturity amount, claiming the NSC was invalid because it was purchased in the name of a business, not an individual. The appellant filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which was initially successful, but later overturned by the State and National Commissions.","The State and National Commissions relied on Rule 17 of the Post Office Savings Bank General Rules, 1981, and precedents like *Post Master, Dargamitta HPO, Nellor v. Raja Prameeelamma* and *Arulmighu Dhandayadhapaniswamy Thirukoil, Palani, Tamil Nadu v. Director General of Post Offices*, which held that contracts contrary to government notifications are unlawful and not binding. The Supreme Court considered arguments based on estoppel, citing *Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India*, but ultimately found the Post Office liable based on deficiency of service and principles of equity.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the orders of the State and National Commissions and restoring the order of the District Forum, with modifications to the interest rate and compensation amount."

1. Instant is a statutory Appeal which is filed by the Appellant under Section 125 of the Electricity
Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’). This Appeal arises out of the judgment and order
dated 3rd May, 2013 passed by Appellate Tribunal for Electricity.
2. By the aforesaid judgment, the Appellate Tribunal has affirmed the orders of the Odisha
Electricity Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’). The essence
of these orders is that even when the Appellant is a “Deemed Distribution Licensee” for the purpose
of Electricity Act, it is still liable to pay Cross Subsidy Surcharge (CSS) to the","M/s. Sesa Sterlite Ltd, a developer in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), appealed against orders requiring them to pay Cross Subsidy Surcharge (CSS) to WESCO, a Distribution Licensee. Sesa Sterlite argued that as a deemed distribution licensee within the SEZ, they shouldn't be considered a consumer of WESCO, especially since they procure power from Sterlite Energy Ltd. The dispute centers on whether Sesa Sterlite, as a deemed licensee, is liable to pay CSS to the distribution licensee for the area.","The judgment primarily analyzes the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically Section 14(b) and its proviso regarding deemed distribution licensees in SEZs, and Section 2(15) defining ""consumer."" It also references the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 and its provisions related to developers. The court's interpretation focuses on whether the deeming fiction of Section 14 automatically dispenses with the requirement of obtaining a license under the Electricity Act and whether a deemed licensee can be considered a consumer.",Not available in document

The dispute centered on the paternity of the child, with the husband claiming he had no physical relationship with his wife during the relevant period. The wife sought maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.","The court considered the relevance of DNA test results in determining paternity, particularly in light of Section 112 of the Evidence Act, which creates a presumption of legitimacy for children born during a valid marriage. The court also examined precedents like Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B., Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Dutta, and Bhabani Prasad Jena v.

2. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 12.4.2013 passed by
the Nation",Narinder Singh filed a consumer complaint against New India Assurance Company Ltd. after his insurance claim for damages to his vehicle was repudiated. The insurance company rejected the claim because the vehicle's temporary registration had expired and the driver allegedly lacked a valid license at the time of the accident. The dispute centers around whether the insurance company was justified in rejecting the claim outright.,"The court analyzed Sections 39 and 43 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which mandate vehicle registration and govern temporary registrations. The court interpreted these sections to mean that driving an unregistered vehicle on a public road is an offense and a fundamental breach of the insurance policy. The court distinguished the precedent cited by the appellant, Amalendu Sahoo vs. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., and found it inapplicable in this case.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the decisions of the State Commission and the National Commission, which had ruled against the appellant's claim for compensation."

Taluka Alibag, District Raigad, in the State of Maharashtra. In RCS No.87 of 1984 filed by the said

The defendants claimed they were tenants. The dispute centered on whether the defendants occupied the premises as gratuitous licensees or as tenants, impacting the plaintiff's right to possession.","The court analyzed whether the plaintiff could raise contradictory pleas of license and tenancy in the same suit.

appeal questioning the judgment and order dated 30.10.2013 passed by the Division Bench of the
High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Ch","Raman, a minor, suffered severe injuries due to electrocution from a naked electric wire. He filed a writ petition seeking compensation from Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. (UHBVN) for negligence. The core issue revolves around the electricity department's alleged failure to maintain safety standards, leading to the accident and subsequent triple amputation of the child's limbs.","The learned Single Judge adverted to Section 68 of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003 and Rule 91 of the Electricity Rules, 1956 which lay down the procedure of safety and protective devices to be provided for overhead electric lines. The learned Single Judge further referred to Rules 29, 44 and 46 of the Rules which are statutory in nature which require the electricity authorities to conduct periodical inspection of the lines maintained by them and to take all such safety measures to prevent accident and maintain the lines in such a manner that life and property of the general public is protected.

2. These appeals are directed against the common judgment and order dated 16.05.2012 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Letters Patent Appeal Nos.1845 and 1916 of 2011. By the
aforesaid impugned order, the High Court has directed that the respondent No.7 herein who was
placed at serial No.2 of the select list/merit panel for award of dealership of retail outlet under the
respondent No.1, i.e. M/s. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd., be offered the said dealership after
completing the process contemplated under the selection procedure ","Sanjay Kumar Shukla appealed against a High Court order directing Bharat Petroleum to offer a retail outlet dealership to Respondent No. 7, who was second on the merit list. The dispute arose after Respondent No. 7 filed a complaint against the selection process, alleging irregularities in the marking and the suitability of the land offered by Shukla.","The judgment primarily focuses on the procedural fairness and factual accuracy of the selection process conducted by Bharat Petroleum, rather than directly applying specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act. The Court examined the High Court's application of Clause 16 of the 'Norms' (Procedure For Selection Of Petrol/Diesel Retail Outlet Dealers) and considered whether relevant facts were overlooked during the High Court proceedings. The court also cited Raunaq International Ltd. Vs. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. & Ors. regarding the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction in contractual matters.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the High Court's order and directing Bharat Petroleum to proceed with granting the dealership to Sanjay Kumar Shukla, the appellant."

1. This statutory appeal under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the
“Act”) is directed against the final judgment and order dated 22nd February, 2013 passed by the
Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (hereinafter referred to as “APTEL” or “Appellate Tribunal”), at
New Delhi in Appeal No. 176 of 2011, whereby it has dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant
against the final judgment and order dated 17th June, 2011 of Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory
Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in D.R.P. No. 12 of 2009. The facts
have been noticed in detail both by the State Com","T.N. Generation & Distbn. Corpn. Ltd. (appellant) and PPN Power Gen. Co. Pvt. Ltd. (respondent) are in dispute over payments related to a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) where the respondent supplies electricity to the appellant. The appellant withheld disputed amounts from monthly invoices, claiming deductions and rebates, while the respondent alleges non-payment and unilateral disallowances. The core grievance revolves around the calculation of amounts due under the PPA, including rebates, interest, and the method of adjusting payments.","The judgment primarily focuses on the interpretation of the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically Section 125 regarding statutory appeals, and the jurisdiction of the State Commission under Section 86(1)(f). The court also considered the Indian Contract Act, 1872, particularly Section 60 regarding the 'FIFO' method of payment adjustment. The court cited Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. Vs. Essar Power Ltd. regarding the State Commission's discretion to adjudicate disputes or refer them to arbitration. The court determined that the Limitation Act would not apply to the proceedings under the Electricity Act.","The appeal by T.N. Generation & Distbn. Corpn. Ltd. was dismissed, upholding the decision of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) which had affirmed the State Commission's order directing the appellant to refund excess rebate availed and ordering the respondent to redraw monthly invoices according to the State Commission's directions."

The present appeals arise out of the impugned judgment and order dated 02.07.2012 passed in Writ
Appeal Nos. 411 of 2006 and 410 of 2006 by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore, whereby the
High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants, thereby upholding the judgment and order
of the learned single judge passed in Writ Petition Nos. 22453 of 2004 and 17054 of 2004, setting
aside order dated 9.2.2004 passed in the Revision Petition No. CMW 33 CAP 98 by the Minister of
Cooperation on the ground that the Revision Petition filed by the appella","The case involves small farmers (appellants) who took a loan from Kadur Taluk Primary Co-Operative Land Development Bank Ltd. and mortgaged their land as security. The dispute arose after the bank auctioned the land due to the farmers' inability to repay the loan, and the farmers challenged the auction sale. The main grievance is the validity of the auction sale and the applicability of a government circular offering interest waivers.","The judgment primarily revolves around the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, 1959 (KCS Act) and the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Rules, 1960 (KCS Rules), specifically Sections 108 and 106 of the KCS Act and Rule 38 of the KCS Rules. The court examined the issue of limitation in filing revision petitions and the validity of the auction sale confirmation under these provisions. The High Court held that the revision petition was barred by limitation and the government circular offering interest waivers did not apply after the property was transferred to a third party.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals, upholding the High Court's decision that favored the auction purchaser. The original order setting aside the sale confirmation was quashed, effectively validating the auction."

The central dispute revolves around whether service tax can be applied to composite contracts involving both goods and services before the explicit amendment that made such contracts taxable. The main grievance is the imposition of service tax on the labor and service elements of these contracts.","The court analyzes the historical context, starting with the Gannon Dunkerley case and the subsequent 46th Amendment to the Constitution, which allowed states to levy sales tax on goods involved in works contracts. The court examines Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, particularly the definition of ""taxable service,"" to determine if it covers the labor and service elements of indivisible works contracts.

2. Seven appeals are before us; some of them are from the Bombay High Court judgme",The case involves appeals against various High Court and Tribunal judgments concerning the legality and validity of anti-dumping duties imposed on imports. The dispute centers on whether anti-dumping duties can be levied on imports made during the period between the expiry of provisional anti-dumping duty and the imposition of the final anti-dumping duty. The product involved is not specified in this excerpt.,"The court analyzes Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994, and Section 9A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, which deals with anti-dumping duties. The court interprets these provisions to determine the legality of imposing anti-dumping duties during the period between provisional and final duty impositions. The judgment refers to the principles of retroactivity in the context of anti-dumping duties.",The final outcome of the appeals is not available in this document.

This Civil Appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated 03.07.2007 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Second Appeal No. 516 of 1988 whereby it has set aside the
impugned judgment and orders therein passed by the courts below on the ground that both the
courts below not only committed error of record by misconstruing the facts and evidence on record
but also ignored the specific provisions of law as well as the necessary and relevant case laws and
also wrongly held that the Title Suit No. 68 of 1978 was barred by the principles of res judicata.
The facts which are required to appreciate the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties
are stated in brief hereunder:
The appellant-Indian Oil Corporation Limited (for short “IOCL”) in the year 1971
invited applications from eligible persons under the scheme for awarding the
distributorship of Indane Gas (LPG) Agencies in the town of Muzaffarpur, Bihar. The
said distributorship was reserved","Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) appealed against a High Court judgment that favored Niloufer Siddiqui and others regarding the termination of an Indane Gas distributorship. The distributorship was initially awarded to two ex-servicemen, including Siddiqui's husband, under a partnership. The dispute arose when Siddiqui's husband sought to transfer his share to his wife, which IOCL refused, leading to the termination of the distributorship, which was contested as illegal and unjustified.","The judgment analyzes whether IOCL had the right to terminate the distributorship based on the terms of the allotment letter, specifically condition no. 8 regarding termination with 30 days' notice. The court also considered whether the respondents breached the standard agreement, particularly clause 21 prohibiting the assignment of shares without IOCL's consent. The court referenced the Specific Relief Act, 1963, Section 14(1)(c) regarding contracts that cannot be specifically enforced and cited the precedent of *Her Highness Maharani Shanti Devi P. Gaikwad V. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel & ors* regarding the interpretation of contractual terms.","The appeal was allowed, and the High Court's judgment was set aside, meaning the termination of the distributorship by IOCL was deemed legal and justified."

where a suit can be instituted by the plaintiff.
3. The plaintiff/appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 10643-44/2010 had filed a suit praying for relief
against defendant No.1 so as to prevent infringement of the rights of the plaintiff without obtaining
the licence. The defendant owns cinema halls in Maharashtra and Mumbai where infringement is
alleged and the entire cause of action, as alleged in the plaint, has arisen in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
4. Civil Suit FAO (OS) No. 359/2007 has been filed in the High Court at Delhi, by virtue of the fact
that the Branch Office of ","The Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. filed suits against Sanjay Dalia and Just Lifestyle Pvt. Ltd. for infringement of copyright and trademark, respectively. The defendants raised objections regarding the territorial jurisdiction of the courts where the suits were filed, arguing that the cause of action arose elsewhere, specifically Mumbai, where the defendants' businesses and the plaintiffs' head offices were located.","The court analyzed Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which provide an additional forum for instituting suits where the plaintiff resides or carries on business, notwithstanding the Code of Civil Procedure. The court considered arguments regarding the interpretation of 'carrying on business' and the applicability of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as precedents like Exphar SA & Anr. v.

Aggrieved by the dismissal of her First Appeal Nos. 645 and 646 of 2013 vide order dated 8.1.2014
by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, purported to have been filed
under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short ""the Act""), against the order dated
30.7.2013 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Lucknow in Appeal Nos.

contentions seeking for setting aside the said order.

The District Forum initially ruled in her favor, but subsequent orders and appeals led to a complex legal battle regarding the execution of the original order. The core grievance is the non-allotment of the plot despite a favorable initial ruling.","The court analyzed Section 27 and 27A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding appeals against orders passed under Section 27. It held that a second appeal to the National Commission against the State Commission's order under Section 27A is not maintainable. However, the court also noted that the State Commission erred in not remanding the case to the District Forum to follow the procedure under the Code of Criminal Procedure for penal action against the respondents.","The Supreme Court upheld the National Commission's decision that the second appeal was not maintainable, but modified the State Commission's order by remanding the case to the District Forum to execute the decree and take penal action against the respondents following the procedure under the Code of Criminal Procedure."

The present appeal, by special leave, assails the judgment and order dated 20.08.2007 passed by
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short “the Commission’) in
First Appeal No.189 of 2007 whereby it has affirmed the Judgment and Order dated 15.2.2007
passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Union Territory of Chandigarh (for
short, “the State Commission”) in complaint case No. 82/2002 (Pb)/RBT No. 46 of 2006 wherein
the State Commission had rejected the claim of the complainant-appellant on two counts, namely,
the claim was barred by limitation, and that under the postulates of the policy, it was totally
untenable.
2. The factual score that is essential to be depicted is that the appellant, a small scale industry and a
proprietary concern dealing in handicraft goods, being desirous of exporting its goods to a buyer,
namely, M/s Treasures of India, Atlanta, USA took insurance","M/s BHS Industries, a handicraft goods exporter, filed a complaint against Export Credit Guarantee Corp. after the insurer repudiated their claim for non-payment when a buyer refused to accept shipments. The insurance policy covered export risks, and the dispute arose from alleged violations of the policy terms by the exporter, including changes in payment terms and failure to properly handle the rejected goods. The main grievance is the repudiation of the insurance claim by the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation.","The court scrutinized the insurance policy terms, emphasizing that insurance contracts require utmost good faith and full disclosure. The court referred to precedents like United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. M.K.J. Corpn., Amalgamated Electricity Co. v. Ajmer Municipality, Bay Berry Apartments (P) Ltd. and Another v. Shobha and others, and Polymer India (P) Ltd. and Another v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. and Others to highlight the importance of interpreting contracts as understood by the parties and construing the terms strictly. The court examined specific clauses related to payment terms, declaration of shipments, and the obligation to protect the goods.","The appeal was dismissed, affirming the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's decision that the appellant violated the terms of the insurance policy and was not diligent in protecting the shipment."

The court considered whether the Defendant-Appellant's prior registration of ROFOL in 1992 would override the Plaintiff-Respondents' established goodwill in the market for PROFOL, given the Defendant-Appellant's delayed entry into the market in 2004.

Ltd. concerning the interpretation of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, specifically regarding the limitation period for filing a written statement by the opposite party in a consumer complaint. The core issue revolves around whether the District Forum can extend the time beyond 45 days for the opposite party to submit their version of the case.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which stipulates a 30-day period for the opposite party to respond to a complaint, extendable by a maximum of 15 days by the District Forum. The court considered conflicting precedents, Dr. J.J. Merchant & Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, which held the 45-day limit as mandatory, and Kailash v. Nanhku & Ors., which treated a similar time limit under the CPC as directory. The court ultimately reaffirmed the mandatory nature of the 45-day limit as per Dr. J.J. Merchant, emphasizing the Act's objective of speedy dispute resolution.","The Supreme Court upheld the view that the District Forum can only grant a maximum of 15 days beyond the initial 30 days for the opposite party to file their version or reply, reinforcing the mandatory nature of the 45-day limit.

No. 1846 of 2000 challenging the award dated 26.05.1999 passed by the Industrial Tribunal, Tamil
Nadu, in I.D. No.66 of 1991, wherein it was held that non- regularisation of the concerned workmen
in the dispute is not justified and directed the appellant-Corporation to regu","ONGC Ltd. appealed against the High Court's decision to uphold the Industrial Tribunal's award, which directed ONGC to regularize the services of certain workmen. The dispute arose from ONGC's decision not to regularize workmen who were initially employed as security guards through contractors and later through a Co-operative Society. The core grievance was the non-regularization of these workmen despite their long service.","The case primarily revolves around the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, specifically Section 10 (reference of disputes to tribunals) and Section 18(1) (settlements between trade unions and management). The Tribunal and High Court relied on the principle that the workmen had completed 480 days of work, entitling them to regularization under the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981. The Supreme Court considered arguments regarding the legality of the initial appointments and the applicability of the Uma Devi case concerning regularization of illegally appointed employees.",Not available in document

The appellants argued that the notifications were ultra vires Section 3 of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and violated Article 14 of the Constitution, as they increased transportation costs and discriminated against businesses in Kerala. The core grievance stemmed from the increased cost of importing crude palm oil due to the port restrictions.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of Section 5 read with Section 3 of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992, which the Central Government used as the basis for issuing the import prohibition notifications. The appellants argued that these sections did not grant the government the power to issue such restrictions. The court had to determine whether the government's actions were within the scope of the powers conferred by the Act and whether the restrictions were justified and non-discriminatory under Article 14 of the Constitution.",Not available in document

Constitutional validity of Entry 25 of Schedule VI to the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Act') is the subject matter of the present appeal. It is the third endeavour to
resurrect this entry, when on the first two occasions, the steps taken by the State were declared as
impermissible. Even this time, the High Court has dumped the amendment as unconstitutional.
However, the reasons advanced by the High Court in all three rounds are different. While traversing
through the historical facts leading to the issue at hand, we shall be referring to the same for clear
understanding of the controversy involved.
2) This entry ","The State of Karnataka appealed against M/S Pro Lab & Ors. regarding the constitutional validity of Entry 25 of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, which levies tax on the processing and supply of photographs, photo prints, and photo negatives. The State had previously attempted to enforce this entry, but it was declared unconstitutional by the High Court. The main grievance is whether the State has the power to levy sales tax on what the respondents argue is predominantly a service.","The court analyzed the legislative competence of the State to insert Entry 25, focusing on whether the processing and supplying of photographs is predominantly a service or involves a sale of goods. The court referred to the Constitution (46th Amendment) Act, 1982, which inserted clause (29-A) in Article 366 of the Constitution, empowering states to tax the 'sale of goods' component in works contracts. The court also analyzed precedents like Gannon Dunkerley and Co. and others v. State of Rajasthan and others and Builders Association of India and others v. Union of India and others to determine the scope of the expression ""tax of sale for purchase of goods"".",Not available in document

The instant appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10.03.2015 passed by the
Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Appeal No. 572 of 2013 whereby it has
concurred with the view expressed by the learned Single Judge in Chamber Summons No. 720/2013
in Arbitration Petition No. 799/2013 dated 10.10.2013 whereunder the learned Single Judge had
revoked the leave granted by the court under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent to file a petition under
Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for brevity, “the 1996 Act”).
2. The facts which","Sumer Builders Pvt. Ltd. and Narendra Gorani entered into an agreement for the development of land in Indore. Disputes arose regarding payments, leading Gorani to terminate the agreement and invoke the arbitration clause. Sumer Builders then filed an application in the Bombay High Court seeking leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, arguing that the court had territorial jurisdiction.","The court analyzed Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, which governs the Bombay High Court's original civil jurisdiction, and the definition of a ""suit for land."" It considered precedents like *Moolji Jaitha & Co. v. Khandesh Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd.* and *Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. Daulat and Anr.*, concluding that a suit is for land if the relief claimed relates to title or possession of immovable property.","The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision to revoke the leave, finding that the dispute was fundamentally a ""suit for land"" and therefore the Bombay High Court lacked territorial jurisdiction."

Coke Industries and other similar companies, private entities engaged in the coal business, filed writ petitions against Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), a public sector undertaking, seeking a refund of excess amounts paid for coal under an e-auction scheme that was later declared unconstitutional. The companies argued that they were entitled to a refund with interest, based on previous Supreme Court decisions regarding the same e-auction scheme.","The document does not explicitly mention the Consumer Protection Act or any specific statutes related to consumer protection. The legal reasoning primarily revolves around the validity of the e-auction scheme under Article 14 of the Constitution, the principles of delay and laches, and the applicability of the principle of undue enrichment. The High Court initially dismissed the writ petitions based on arguments of delay, the contractual nature of the claim, and the absence of a specific court order mandating a refund.","The Division Bench of the Patna High Court allowed the appeals filed by Central Coalfields Ltd. and dismissed the writ petitions filed by S.J. Coke Industries and other similar companies, reversing the Single Judge's order for a refund."

The Municipal Employees Union raised an industrial dispute claiming the workers were entitled to permanency after years of service. The core grievance was the denial of benefits and allowances given to permanent employees despite performing the same work.,"The court applied Section 2(ra) and 25(T) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, regarding unfair labor practices, specifically Entry No. 10 of the Fifth Schedule, which prohibits employing workers as casual or temporary employees for extended periods to deprive them of permanent status. The court cited Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation and Anr. v. Casteribe Rajya P. Karmchari Sanghatana and Durgapur Casual Workers Union v. Food Corporation of India to support the view that denying permanent status to long-serving employees performing the same work as permanent employees constitutes unfair labor practice.","The appeals were dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision and the Labour Court's Award, effectively granting permanency to the safai kamdars."

SUDHANSU JYOTI MUKHOPADHAYA,J The appellants have preferred this appeal against orders
dated 19th November, 2013 and 5th March, 2014 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal, Principal
Bench at New Delhi in O.A. No.401 of 2013 and R.A No.11 of 2014 with M.A No.120 of 2014 in O.A.
No.401 of 2013 respectively. By the impugned order dated 19th November, 2013, the Tribunal
allowed the original appeal filed by the respondent and held that the respondent rendered actual
service to the extent of 14 years by rounding off, which makes him eligible for consideration of
condonation of shortfall of pensionable service of one year and in view of striking off of Rule 82(a)
the respondent cannot be denied the benefit of condonation of shortfall in service on the ground
that he took the discharge from service voluntarily on his own request. Therefore,",The Union of India appealed against orders of the Armed Forces Tribunal regarding Surender Singh Parmar's pension. Parmar sought condonation of a shortfall in his pensionable service in the Indian Navy. The dispute centered on whether he was eligible for condonation despite voluntarily retiring and the interpretation of service length calculation rules.,"The court considered Navy (Pension) Regulations 1964 and Government of India instructions regarding condonation of service shortfall and calculation of qualifying service. It upheld the striking down of Regulation 82(a) (which denied condonation to those who voluntarily retired) by the Bombay High Court, as it was not challenged. The court also relied on instructions allowing fractions of a year to be counted towards qualifying service.","The appeal was partially allowed. The court upheld the Tribunal's decision to condone Parmar's service shortfall but modified the order to grant him pension benefits effective from August 14, 2001 (the date of the relevant instruction), not prior to that date."

1. The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as, the SEBI Act)
was enacted to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of,
and to regulate, the securities market. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter
referred to as, the Board) was vested with statutory powers to effectively deal with all matters
rel","Videocon International Ltd. appealed against an order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay regarding the interpretation of Section 15Z of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Act, as amended in 2002. The core dispute was whether the amendment, which changed the appellate forum from the High Court to the Supreme Court, and limited appeals to questions of law, applied retrospectively or prospectively to orders passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal before the amendment's effective date.","The court analyzed Section 15Z of the SEBI Act, both before and after the 2002 amendment, along with related sections like 15Y (Civil court not to have jurisdiction) and Sections 27 and 32 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Amendment) Act, 2002. The court considered arguments regarding whether the amendment was procedural and thus retrospective, and whether a vested right was taken away. The court also examined the impact of the repeal and saving clause in the amending act.",Not available in document

2. On 30.8.1996, the appellant V. Krishankumar'","V. Krishnakumar filed a complaint against the State of Tamil Nadu, its Government Hospital, and two doctors alleging medical negligence in failing to screen his premature baby for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), leading to blindness. The dispute centers around the lack of proper medical care and advice regarding the risk of ROP in premature infants who receive oxygen and blood transfusions. The service involved is neonatal care provided by a government hospital.","The judgment focuses on the standard of care expected from medical professionals in managing premature infants at risk of ROP. The court relied on medical literature and expert opinion from AIIMS to establish that screening for ROP was a mandatory and well-known practice at the time. The court found that the hospital and doctors were negligent in failing to conduct the screening and warn the parents about the risk, constituting a deficiency in service.","The appeals were related to the NCDRC's finding of medical negligence. While the document indicates that the NCDRC awarded Rs. 5,00,000 to V. Krishnakumar, the final outcome of the appeals (whether the compensation was enhanced or reduced) is not explicitly stated in the provided text."

Ltd. to unconditionally withdraw a deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs made before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) as a pre-condition for entertaining an appeal under the SARFAESI Act. The dispute revolves around whether the bank has the right to appropriate this deposit against the dues of SBS Organics, the borrower, after the Securitisation Application was disposed of setting aside the sale.","The Supreme Court analyzed the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, particularly Section 13 and Section 18, along with Rule 11 of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, and Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act. The court considered whether the deposit made as a pre-condition for appeal under Section 18 could be appropriated by the bank against the borrower's dues, or if it should be refunded upon withdrawal of the appeal. The court also examined the scheme of the SARFAESI Act, intended for faster recovery of loans by banks and financial institutions.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by Axis Bank, affirming the High Court's decision to allow SBS Organics to unconditionally withdraw the deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs."

The appellant sought to refer the matter to arbitration based on a clause in their partnership deed, but the respondents alleged fraud by the appellant.","The appellant invoked Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, arguing for mandatory referral to arbitration. The respondents relied on the N. Radhakrishnan precedent, claiming fraud allegations are unsuitable for arbitration. The court analyzed the scope of judicial intervention under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, particularly Sections 5, 16, 34, and 48, emphasizing minimal intervention and the arbitrator's initial jurisdiction to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement.",Not available in document

1. “Change” it is famously said is all that is constant in the world. And yet the world hates change, no
matter, it is only change that has brought progress for mankind. Statesmen, Scholars and Scientists
have spoken for change and eulogised its significance. For instance Charles Darwin has spoken of
‘change’ in the context of his theory of evolution and declared “It is not the strongest of the species
that survive, not the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” Benjamin Franklin,
put it more pithily when he said “When you’re finished changing, you’re finished”. Albert Ein","The case involves the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Cricket Association of Bihar, among others. The dispute revolves around allegations of sporting fraud, conflict of interest within the BCCI, and the need for reforms to ensure transparency and ethical standards in cricket administration. The core issue is the implementation of recommendations made by the Justice Lodha Committee to streamline the BCCI's operations and prevent future controversies.","The court examined the functioning of the BCCI in light of its public functions, holding that even though the BCCI is not a ""State"" under Article 12, it is subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution due to its important public functions. The court emphasized the need for the BCCI to adhere to principles of reasonableness, fairness, accountability, and transparency, essentially applying principles of 'Public Law'. The judgment focuses on the need for reforms and doesn't explicitly cite or interpret sections of the Consumer Protection Act.","The judgment primarily focuses on the need for reforms within the BCCI based on the Lodha Committee's recommendations. The final outcome regarding specific appeals is not explicitly stated in this excerpt, but the court is clearly leaning towards implementing the reforms to improve the BCCI's governance."

The Respondent alleged deficiency of service due to the delay and sought compensation for escalation in construction costs and other losses. The service in question is the provision of a developed plot of land by HUDA.","The court referred to Section 14(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, emphasizing that compensation is contingent on proof of loss or injury due to the opposite party's negligence. It cited precedents like Charan Singh v. Healing Touch Hospital and Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh to highlight the principles for determining fair and reasonable compensation in consumer disputes, considering factors like harassment and increased property value.",Not available in document

1. Is the tariff fixed under a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) sacrosanct and inviolable and beyond
review and correction by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission which is the statutory
authority for fixation of tariff under the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter for short ‘the Act’). This is
the short question that arises for determination in the present appeals. The Regulatory Commission
did not consider it appropriate to confer on itself the said power upon a construction of the
provisions of the Act and the terms of the PPA(s) in question. The Appellate Tribuna","Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL), a distribution licensee, appealed against orders of the Appellate Tribunal that allowed State Electricity Regulatory Commissions to review tariffs fixed under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with power producers like Tarini Infrastructure Ltd. and Junagadh Power Projects Pvt. Ltd. The power producers sought tariff revisions due to unforeseen cost increases (transmission line distance, biomass fuel costs) after the PPAs were signed. GUVNL argued that the fixed tariffs in the PPAs were sacrosanct and could not be unilaterally altered.","The court analyzed the Electricity Act, 2003, particularly Sections 61, 62, 64, and 86, to determine the State Regulatory Commission's power to fix and revise tariffs. The court considered precedents like Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited Vs. EMCO Ltd. & Anr. and Bangalore Electricity Supply Co. Vs. Konark Power Projects Ltd., while also distinguishing them. The court interpreted Section 86(1)(b) regarding the power to regulate electricity prices procured through agreements, emphasizing the statutory function of tariff determination by the State Regulatory Commission.",Not available in document

1. The 2nd respondent herein, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission is a body constituted
under Section 82 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”). In exercise of its
statutory powers under Sections 61(h), 62(1)(a) and 86(1)(e) of the Act the 2nd respondent issued
Order No.2 of 2010 dated 29.01.2010 (hereinafter referred to as the “1st Tariff Order”) determining
the tariff for procurement of power by the Distribution Licensees in Gujarat from Solar Energy
Projects[1]. The said order was issued after an elaborate consideration of the various relevant factors
including the policy guidelines of the State of Gujarat and Union of India. Under the said order,
tariff for procurement of electricity generated by PROJECTS employing So","Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) and Emco Ltd. entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the sale and purchase of electricity from Emco's solar power project. The dispute arose because Emco commissioned the project after the initial tariff order's control period and did not avail accelerated depreciation, leading to disagreement on the applicable tariff. GUVNL appealed against the order of the Appellate Tribunal which confirmed the order of the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) favoring Emco.","The court analyzed the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically Sections 61(h), 62(1)(a), 82, 86(1)(e) and 86(1)(f), along with the Income Tax Act's Section 32 regarding accelerated depreciation. The court interpreted the tariff orders issued by the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) to determine the applicable tariff for solar projects commissioned after the initial control period and not availing accelerated depreciation. The court considered the terms of the PPA and supplemental agreement between GUVNL and Emco.",Not available in document

Part I : Introductory
1. This appeal has been preferred under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (‘the Act’) against
the judgment and order dated 22nd February, 2010 passed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity
(the Tribunal) in Appeal No.86 of 2009 whereby the Tribunal has set aside the order of the Gujarat
Electricity Regulatory Commission (‘the Commission’) which was in favour of the appellant.
2. The substantial question of law sought to be raised by the appellant is :
“Whether the Tribunal has correctly interpreted the terms of Power Purchase
Agreement dated 30th May, 1996 (PPA) and is justified in reversing the finding of the
Commission based on interpretation of the said PPA and other documents on
record.?” Part II : Facts
3","Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) appealed against Essar Power Limited (EPL) regarding a dispute arising from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). GUVNL claimed that EPL wrongly allocated electricity to its sister concern, Essar Steel Ltd (ESL), instead of allocating it proportionally as per the PPA, causing financial loss to GUVNL. The core issue revolves around the interpretation of the PPA's terms regarding electricity allocation between GUVNL and ESL when generation was less than the total capacity.","The judgment primarily focuses on interpreting the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd and Essar Power Limited, specifically Article 3.1 regarding the allocation of electricity. The court considered precedents regarding contract interpretation, emphasizing the need to read the PPA as a whole to ascertain the parties' intention. The court analyzed the definition of 'Allocated Capacity' in conjunction with Article 3.1 to determine if the allocation was intended to be proportionate between GUVNL and Essar Steel.",Not available in document

We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The only question that has arisen in this appeal is
whether a second complaint to the District Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is
maintainable when the first complaint was dismissed for default or non- prosecution.
The Nation","Indian Machinery Company filed a complaint against M/S. Ansal Housing & Construction Ltd. under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The dispute centers around whether a second consumer complaint is maintainable after the first complaint was dismissed for default or non-prosecution. The specific product or service involved is not detailed in this excerpt.","The Supreme Court considered whether a second complaint under the Consumer Protection Act is maintainable after the first was dismissed for default, noting the absence of a provision similar to Order 9 Rule 9(1) of the CPC, which prohibits a second suit on the same cause of action after dismissal for default. The court relied on the precedent set in *New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. R. Srinivasan*, which held that in the absence of a specific prohibition in the Consumer Protection Rules, a second complaint is permissible if the first was dismissed in default and the complainant provides an explanation.","The appeal was allowed, and the order passed by the National Commission was set aside. The matter was remitted back to the National Commission for adjudicating the disputes on merits."

In the book on the rights of differently abled persons authored by Joseph P. Shapiro, which is titled
“NO PITY”[1], the first chapter, 'Introduction' has the sub-title 'You Just Don't Understand' and the
very first sentence of the said book is : 'Nondisabled Americans do not understand disabled ones'.
The present PIL, spearheaded by Jeeja Ghosh, who is herself a disabled person, with the support of
the NGO ADAPT (Able Disable All People Together), bears testimony to the statement of Shapiro.
Irony is that though the aforesaid remarks were made by Shapiro way back in the year 1","Jeeja Ghosh, a disabled activist, and ADAPT (an NGO) filed a writ petition after Ms. Ghosh was de-boarded from a SpiceJet flight due to her cerebral palsy, causing her humiliation and preventing her from attending an international conference. The petitioners alleged violation of her fundamental rights and sought systemic changes to prevent similar incidents for other disabled persons. The case involves air travel services and discrimination against a consumer based on disability.","The court considered the violation of Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR, 2008) issued by the DGCA, which prohibits airlines from refusing to carry persons with disabilities and mandates sensitization training for airline staff. The court also referenced the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), emphasizing the state's obligation to protect the rights of disabled individuals and ensure reasonable accommodation. The judgment emphasizes the need to enforce existing regulations and change societal attitudes towards disabled persons.","The document is truncated, so the final outcome and specific relief granted are not available. Therefore, the decision summary is: Not available in document"

Lakhmi Chand vs Reliance General Insurance on 7 January, 2016
Indian Kanoon -","Lakhmi Chand, the owner of a goods-carrying vehicle insured with Reliance General Insurance, filed a consumer complaint after his claim for damages due to an accident was rejected. The insurance company rejected the claim because the vehicle was carrying more passengers than permitted under the policy. The appellant argued that this violation should not negate the insurance claim.","The Supreme Court relied on precedents like B.V. Nagaraju v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd and National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Swaran Singh & Ors, stating that carrying more passengers than permitted does not automatically constitute a fundamental breach of the insurance policy unless it directly contributed to the accident. The court emphasized that the insurer must prove the breach and its causal link to the damage.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the orders of the National Commission and State Commission, and directed the respondent-Company to pay 75% of the assessed repair amount of Rs. 90,000 to the appellant along with 9% interest from the date of lodging the claim."

Redressal Commission, Ahemdabad in","Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel, a charitable institution running a girls' hostel, purchased vitrified glazed floor tiles from M/S H & R Johnson (India) Ltd. The tiles developed defects after installation, leading the Society to file a consumer complaint alleging unfair trade practices and seeking compensation for the defective tiles and related expenses. The dispute centers on whether the Society qualifies as a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, focusing on the definition of 'consumer' and whether the purchase was for commercial purposes. The court distinguished the case from *M/s Kusumam Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Neycer India Ltd.*, emphasizing that the hostel was run as a charitable activity, not for profit. The Court held that the National Commission exceeded its revisional jurisdiction under Section 21(b) by overturning the concurrent findings of the District Forum and State Commission.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the National Commission's order and restoring the orders of the District Forum and State Commission, which had awarded damages to the appellant-Society."

1. Leave granted. The question raised in this appeal is whether the High Court was justified in
setting aside the award of the Motor Accidents C","Malati Sardar filed a claim for compensation with the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in Kolkata after her son died in an accident in Hoogly involving a bus insured by National Insurance Company Ltd. The insurance company appealed, arguing the Kolkata Tribunal lacked territorial jurisdiction since the accident and claimant's residence were in Hoogly. The High Court sided with the insurance company, leading to this appeal before the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court considered Section 166(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, which allows claims to be filed where the defendant resides. Citing Mantoo Sarkar vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, the court emphasized that the insurance company's business presence in Kolkata conferred jurisdiction to the Kolkata Tribunal. The court also invoked Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code, stating that objections to territorial jurisdiction should not be entertained absent a failure of justice.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's judgment, and restored the original award of the Tribunal in favor of Malati Sardar."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18780025","M/S Shanti Conductors(P) Ltd. filed a suit against Assam State Electricity Board for recovery of interest on delayed payments for the supply of Aluminium Electrical Conductors. The Electricity Board contended that the Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 is not applicable as the contract was concluded before the Act's enactment. The appeals arose because the High Court held the appellants were not entitled to interest as the contracts predated the Act's commencement.","The core legal issue revolves around the applicability of the Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 to contracts entered into before the Act came into force. The appellants argued for a retroactive application of the Act, citing the Act's objectives and relying on precedents like Modern Industries v. Steel Authority of India Ltd. The court considered previous judgments, including Purbanchal Cables & Conductors Pvt. Ltd. and Assam Small Scale Industries Development Corporation Ltd., which offered differing interpretations regarding the relevance of the 'sale agreement' date versus the 'transaction' or 'supply order' date.",Not available in document

dismissing the Revision Petition No.671/2011 and also the Review Application No.142/2011, thereby

Commission, Haryana (for short ‘State Commiss","Pardeep Sharma was allotted a plot by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) but possession was delayed due to a cost enhancement dispute. Sharma sought possession through the District Consumer Forum, which ruled in his favor, but HUDA appealed. The core issue is whether Sharma, having accepted a refund, retains the right to claim possession of the plot.","The judgment primarily revolves around the question of whether Pardeep Sharma remained a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act after accepting a refund from HUDA. The State Commission and National Commission initially ruled that accepting the refund negated his consumer status. However, the Supreme Court considered the unique circumstances, including HUDA's internal inconsistencies in regularizing the allotment and granting permissions despite ongoing legal challenges.","The appeals were allowed, and the Supreme Court directed HUDA to permit Pardeep Sharma to retain the plot, subject to him paying the current HUDA rate (as of 2014-15) after adjusting the amount already deposited."

1. The core question of law arising in this group of appeals being similar and the facts involved being
largely identical, all the appeals which were heard analogously are being decided by this common
order.
2. The question of law arising in this group of appeals may be summarized as follows.
What is the degree of proof required to hold brokers/sub-brokers liable for fraudulent/
manipulative practices under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Fraudulent
and Unfair Trade Practices ","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) filed appeals against multiple brokers and sub-brokers, including Kishore R. Ajmera, Ess Ess Intermediaries Pvt. Ltd., Rajendra Jayantilal Shah, Rajesh N. Jhaveri and Networth Stock Broking Ltd., alleging fraudulent and manipulative trading practices in the securities market. The core issue revolves around whether these brokers/sub-brokers engaged in activities like synchronized trading and creating artificial volumes in illiquid scrips, violating SEBI regulations and the Code of Conduct.","The central legal question is the degree of proof required to hold brokers/sub-brokers liable for fraudulent/manipulative practices under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations and/or liable for violating the Code of Conduct specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992. The judgment analyzes whether the evidence presented by SEBI sufficiently demonstrates violations of these regulations, particularly concerning synchronized trading and its impact on market prices.",The document only presents the background and the question of law. The final outcome of the appeals (whether they were allowed or dismissed) is not available in this excerpt.

2. This group of appea",Smt. B. Narasamma is the appellant against the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Karnataka regarding the rate of taxability of declared goods (iron and steel) used in works contracts for reinforcement of cement concrete in buildings. The dispute centers on whether these iron and steel reinforcements lose their character as iron and steel at the point of taxability in a works contract.,"The court considered Article 286(3) of the Constitution, Section 14 and 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, Section 5(4) and 5-B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, and Section 4 of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003. The court relied on precedents like Builders' Assn. of India v. Union of India and Gannon Dunkerley and Co. v. State of Rajasthan to determine that mere cutting and shaping of iron and steel products does not change their identity as declared goods, thus they are taxable at a lower rate.",Not available in document

The present appeal, by special leave, is directed against the judgment and order passed by the
Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in W.P.T.T. No.652 of 2006, wherein it has affirmed
the view expressed by the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal (for short, 'the tribunal') and disposed of
the appeal preferred by the respondent along with other connected appeals holding, inter alia, that
the assessee, the Calcutta Club Limited, was not liable for payment of sales tax under the West
Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 (for brevity, 'the Act').
2. The facts that are necessary to be stated are that the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial
Taxes issued a notice to the respondent-Club assessee apprising it that it had failed to make
payment of sales tax on sale of food and drinks to the permanent members during the quarter
ending 30.6.2002. After the receipt of the","The State of West Bengal appealed a decision that the Calcutta Club Limited was not liable for sales tax under the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994, on the sale of food and drinks to its permanent members. The revenue department argued that the supply of food and drinks constituted a 'deemed sale' after a constitutional amendment, while the Club contended it acted as an agent for its members, invoking the doctrine of mutuality.","The court analyzed Section 2(30) of the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994, and Article 366(29A) of the Constitution of India, which defines 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' to include the supply of goods by an unincorporated association to its members for consideration. The appellant argued that the constitutional amendment nullified the concept of mutuality, citing Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Union of India. The respondent argued that the concept of mutuality still holds the field, citing Fateh Maidan Club v. Commercial Tax Officer, Hyderabad and Cosmopolitan Club v. State of Tamil Nadu & Others.",Not available in document

United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs M/S. Orient Treasures ","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order to pay M/s Orient Treasures Pvt. Ltd. compensation for a burglary loss at their jewelry shop. The insurance company repudiated the claim, arguing that the stolen items were not covered under the policy's terms because they were kept in the display window and outside the safe during the night, violating specific clauses of the insurance policy. The consumer filed a cross appeal seeking enhancement of the compensation.","The Supreme Court considered clauses 4 and 5 of the proposal form and clause 12 of the policy to determine if the insurance company was justified in repudiating the claim. The insurance company relied on precedents such as General Assurance Society Ltd. vs. Chandumull Jain & Anr. and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal to argue that the policy terms were clear and unambiguous, excluding coverage for items displayed outside the safe during night hours.

Competition Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). Before we mention the nuances of the
issue that has arisen for consideration, it wo","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) appealed against the Co-ordination Committee of Artists and Technicians of W.B. Film and Television and others regarding the telecasting of a dubbed version of the TV serial 'Mahabharat' in Bangla. The Committee and EIMPA opposed the telecast, claiming it would adversely affect local producers, artists, and technicians, and threatened non-cooperation if the telecast continued. The CCI investigated whether this action constituted an anti-competitive agreement under the Competition Act, 2002.","The judgment focuses on Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements, particularly those that limit or control production, supply, or markets. The court examined whether the actions of EIMPA and the Coordination Committee constituted an agreement that had an appreciable adverse effect on competition. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 stipulates four kinds of agreements which are presumed to have appreciable adverse effect on competition.",Not available in document

R.F. Nariman, J.
1. The present appeals raise an interesting question under Section 28A of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (SEBI Act), namely, as to whether interest can be recovered on
orders of penalty issued under the Act and/or orders of disgorgement of unlawful gains, when the
said amounts have remained unpaid. In the penalty cases, it is SEBI who is before us as ap","Dushyant N. Dalal and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are the parties involved in this case. The dispute revolves around whether interest can be recovered on penalty orders and disgorgement orders issued under the SEBI Act when the amounts remain unpaid. The case involves alleged manipulation of shares in initial public offers (IPOs) by Dushyant N. Dalal, resulting in unlawful gains.","The court analyzed Section 28A of the SEBI Act, which deals with the recovery of amounts, and its interaction with Section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The court considered arguments regarding whether interest could be levied retrospectively and whether the absence of an explicit provision for future interest in the initial order precluded its subsequent imposition. Arguments were presented regarding equity, restitution, and the principle that an executing court cannot go behind a decree.","The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) found that SEBI was empowered to collect interest with effect from 18.7.2013, but the final outcome regarding the specific interest payable by the appellants is not explicitly stated in this excerpt. The appeal was dismissed."

     ","This case involves appeals related to power purchase agreements (PPAs) between energy companies like Adani Power and state electricity regulatory commissions and utilities in Gujarat and Haryana. The dispute arose due to a change in Indonesian law that increased the price of imported coal, impacting the cost of power generation. Adani Power sought relief, claiming force majeure or change in law, to revise the tariff agreed upon in the PPAs.","The court analyzed Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003, concerning the procurement of power and determination of tariff through competitive bidding. The court considered arguments related to force majeure under Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and clauses within the PPAs. The Appellate Tribunal ultimately concluded that force majeure was made out on the facts of these cases and reversed the Commission on this score, stating that regulatory powers under Section 79 could not be exercised once there was a PPA entered into under Section 63 of the Act.","The Appellate Tribunal's judgment was that force majeure was established, and the matter was remanded to the Commission to determine compensatory tariff based on the force majeure event."

The central issue is whether privacy is a constitutionally protected right under the Indian Constitution, specifically examining the correctness of earlier decisions in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh which suggested it was not.","The court considered the arguments for and against the existence of a fundamental right to privacy, revisiting earlier judgments like M.P.

relation to an operational","Macquarie Bank Limited, Singapore, purchased the rights to a supply agreement between Hamera International Private Limited and Shilpi Cable Technologies Ltd. Shilpi Cable Technologies allegedly failed to pay for goods supplied under this agreement. Macquarie Bank initiated insolvency proceedings against Shilpi Cable Technologies, which were rejected by the NCLT and NCLAT due to non-compliance with Section 9(3)(c) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the fact that the demand notice was issued by a lawyer.","The appeals raised questions regarding the interpretation of Section 9(3)(c) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically whether it is mandatory and whether a lawyer can issue a demand notice for an unpaid operational debt. Arguments were presented regarding whether ""shall"" in Section 9(3)(c) should be read as ""may"" and whether the definition of ""financial institution"" includes foreign banks. The court considered arguments based on the Advocates Act, 1961, and various sections of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and its associated rules.",Not available in document

1. The present appeal raises questions as to the triggering of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,
2016 when it comes to operational debts owed to operational creditors. The appellant was engaged
by Star TV for conducting tele-voting for the “Nach Baliye” program on Star TV. The appellant in
turn sub-
contracted the work to the respondent and issued purchase orders between October and December,
2013 in favour of the respondent. In the “Nach Baliye” program, the successful dancer was to be
selected on various bases, including viewers’ votes. For this purpose, the respondent ","Mobilox Innovations Private Limited (Appellant) and Kirusa Software Private Limited (Respondent) were in a contractual agreement where the Respondent provided toll-free telephone numbers and customized software for tele-voting in the ""Nach Baliye"" program. The dispute arose when the Appellant withheld payments, claiming the Respondent breached a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) by disclosing their work for the program. This led to a demand notice under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.","The case revolves around the interpretation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically Sections 8 and 9, concerning operational debts and the existence of a 'dispute'. The court analyzed whether the alleged breach of the NDA constituted a valid 'dispute' that would prevent the initiation of insolvency proceedings. The court considered the definition of 'dispute' under Section 5(6) and whether it included the breach of a non-disclosure agreement.","The appeal was allowed, and the case was remitted to the adjudicating authority for reconsideration, specifically to determine if the application was complete and if the dispute was genuine or merely an attempt to evade liability."

1. The present case raises interesting questions which arise under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy
Code of 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the Code), which received the Presidential assent on 28th
May, 2016, but which provisions were brought into force only in November-December, 2016.
2. The appellant before us is a multi-product company catering to applications in diverse sectors.
From August, 2012, owing to labour problems, the appellant began to suffer losses. Since the
appellant was not able to service the financial assistance given to it by 19 banking entities, which had
extended credit to","M/S. Innoventive Industries Ltd, a multi-product company, faced financial difficulties and proposed corporate debt restructuring with 19 banking entities led by ICICI Bank. A master restructuring agreement (MRA) was entered, but ICICI Bank initiated insolvency proceedings against Innoventive Industries, claiming default under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The dispute centered on whether the insolvency proceedings could be initiated despite moratoriums under the Maharashtra Relief Undertakings (Special Provisions Act), 1958, and whether the MRA absolved Innoventive Industries of its debt.","The primary legal issue revolved around the interplay between the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, and the Maharashtra Relief Undertakings (Special Provisions Act), 1958, specifically regarding the moratoriums imposed under the latter. The court considered Section 238 of the Code, which contains a non-obstante clause, and Article 254 of the Constitution regarding repugnancy between state and central laws. The court analyzed whether the two Acts operated in different fields and whether the moratorium under the Maharashtra Act could coexist with the insolvency proceedings under the Code.","While the court noted the appeal was not maintainable by the erstwhile directors, it proceeded to deliver a detailed judgment. The court ultimately upheld the initiation of insolvency proceedings, effectively dismissing the appeal, emphasizing the paradigm shift in allowing creditors to initiate insolvency proceedings against defaulting companies."

The question arising in the first appeal directed against the judgment and order dated 23rd April,
2007 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short ‘the National
Commission’) in Original Petition No. 161 of 1996 is whether the claim ","National Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's (NCDRC) decision to partially accept Hindustan Safety Glass Works Ltd.'s insurance claim for damages caused by flooding. The insured had policies covering their factory and office in Calcutta, and filed claims after heavy rains damaged raw materials, stocks, and furniture. The insurance company delayed settlement and later repudiated the claim, leading to a complaint with the NCDRC.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 24-A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding limitation periods for filing complaints. The court held that the limitation period should not be strictly construed against the consumer, especially when the service provider (National Insurance) caused delays in claim settlement. The court also interpreted condition 6(ii) of the insurance policy, finding that the insured's claim was actionable from the time it was made, not only after approaching a court of law.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by National Insurance, upholding the NCDRC's decision to award Hindustan Safety Glass Works Ltd. Rs. 21,05,803.89 with interest at 9% per annum and costs of Rs. 20,000."

  similar and the facts involved being largely comparable, all the
  appeals were heard together and are being decided by this common
  judgment.

The core dispute revolves around the interpretation and application of the SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (PROHIBITION OF FRAUDULENT AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES RELATING TO SECURITIES MARKET) REGULATIONS, 2003 (FUTP 2003).","The court analyzed the legality of 'non-intermediary front-running' under the FUTP 2003 regulations, specifically focusing on the definition of 'fraud' under Regulation 2(c) and the prohibitions outlined in Regulations 3 and 4. The court considered the object and purpose of FUTP 2003, which is to safeguard the investing public and prevent exploitation through fraudulent schemes. The judgment also references amendments to the regulations made by SEBI to keep up with technology and times.","The document does not provide a final outcome for each individual appeal. It indicates that the appeals were heard together due to similar legal questions and comparable facts, and that one case (CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2594 OF 2013) was remanded back to the Appellate Tribunal."

The dispute revolves around whether a Trust can file a complaint under the Act. The specific product or service involved and the main grievance are not detailed in this excerpt.","The court analyzed Sections 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), and 2(m) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which define 'complainant,' 'consumer,' and 'person.' The court interpreted these sections to mean that a Trust does not fall within the definition of 'person' or 'consumer' under the Act. Therefore, a Trust cannot be a 'complainant' and cannot file a consumer dispute.","The appeals were dismissed, with the court holding that the complaint filed by the appellant Trust was not maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986."

1. This writ petition was taken up on the basis of an article published in the Hindi newspaper
“Hindustan” (Lucknow Edition) on 4thJuly, 2007. The article was written by Ms. Anjali Sinha and
the translated caption of the article is “Orphanage or Places for Child Abuse”. The article was
forwarded to this Court by one A.S. Choudhury along with a letter and that is the genesis of this
petition which was registered as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on 10th September, 2007. Ms.
Aparna Bhat was appointed as Amicus Curiae to assist this Court. At the outset we must and do
acknowledge the unstinting and excellent efforts put in by Ms. Aparna Bhat over the last 10 years in
rendering assistance in this matter.
2. Broadly, the article written by Ms. Anjali Sinha mentions that orphanages in Mahabalipuram in
Tamil Nadu, run by NGOs as well as governm","This Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was initiated based on a newspaper article highlighting the sexual abuse of children in orphanages in Tamil Nadu. The article alleged that orphanages, run by NGOs and government institutions, were involved in providing sexual services of children to foreigners and Indian tourists. The court expanded the scope of the PIL to include the rights of children in general, focusing on the implementation of laws protecting children's rights.","The court emphasized the need for a broad interpretation of the definition of a 'child in need of care and protection' under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, citing precedents that support a liberal interpretation of social welfare legislation. The court referenced Article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and Directive Principles of State Policy under Article 39(f) of the Constitution. It stated that the definition should not be treated as exhaustive but illustrative and furthering the requirements of social justice.",The court did not provide a final outcome in this excerpt. The court heard detailed submissions of all the parties with the intention of passing appropriate directions so as to ensure the meaningful implementation of the statutes already enacted by Parliament.

Leave granted.
2. These appeals are directed against the Judgment dated 02.04.2014 passed by the Bombay High
The Greater Bomb","The Greater Bombay Co-operative Bank sought to recover dues from Mr. Dhillon P. Shah, a guarantor for a loan taken by M/s. Mahaganesh Texpro Private Limited. The bank attached a flat owned by Mr. Shah, but Mr. Nagaraj Ganeshmal Jain claimed ownership of the flat based on an agreement to sell predating the attachment. The dispute centered on the validity of this agreement and whether it transferred ownership, thereby preventing the bank's attachment.","The court relied on the Transfer of Property Act, specifically Sections 54 and 55, and cited the precedent Suraj Lamp & Industries (P) Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana, emphasizing that the transfer of immovable property requires a registered deed of conveyance. An unregistered agreement to sell, even with possession, does not confer title or transfer any interest in the property, except for the limited defense under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, which was not applicable here.","The appeals were allowed, the High Court's order was set aside, and Mr. Nagaraj Ganeshmal Jain's claim of ownership was rejected, meaning he has no right, title, or interest in the suit property."

A.K. SIKRI, J.
All these appeals are filed by the same appellant, namely, M/s. India Hume Pipe Co. Ltd.
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘","M/s. Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. appealed against the State of Rajasthan's imposition of sales tax and penalty under Section 7AA of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954, arguing that their works contract for manufacturing and laying pipelines was indivisible. The Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) had awarded the company contracts for providing and laying pipelines for water supply schemes. The dispute centered on whether the contract was a single, composite works contract or divisible into separate contracts for the supply of goods and services.","The Supreme Court examined whether the contract was a single composite contract or divisible, referencing Article 366(29A)(b) of the Constitution and the precedent set in Kone Elevator India Private Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu. The court distinguished the Kone Elevator case, stating that the present issue was about divisibility, not whether the contract was a works contract. The court affirmed the High Court's finding that the contract was divisible based on the substantial value attributed to the supply of pipes, thus upholding the imposition of sales tax.","The appeals filed by M/s. Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. were dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the works contract was divisible and the imposition of tax and penalties under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 was justified."

   ","The Union of India appealed a Delhi High Court judgment regarding the interpretation of Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The dispute centers on whether prior consultation with the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) is mandatory before the Central Government exercises its power under Section 26A to ban the manufacture and sale of certain drugs, specifically Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs). Pfizer Limited and other pharmaceutical companies are the respondents.","The core issue is the interpretation of Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, specifically whether it mandates prior consultation with the DTAB. The Union argued that Section 26A does not expressly require DTAB consultation, unlike other provisions of the Act. The respondents argued, citing a prior Division Bench judgment and a Supreme Court judgment, that DTAB consultation is essential for the constitutional validity and reasonable application of Section 26A.",Not available in document

The insurance company contested the claim, arguing that the truck was being driven in violation of the insurance policy terms as it lacked a valid permit at the time of the accident.","The court analyzed Sections 2(28), 2(31), 2(47) and 66 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, defining ""motor vehicle,"" ""permit,"" and ""transport vehicle,"" and stipulating the necessity for permits. The court emphasized that a permit must be issued by the competent authority for the use of a motor vehicle as a transport vehicle. The court relied on the precedent set in *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Challa Bharathamma and others* to support the view that lacking a valid permit at the time of the accident constitutes a violation of the policy.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the High Court's decision which confirmed the tribunal's award directing the insurer to pay compensation but allowing them to recover the amount from the owner and driver of the vehicle."

The court examined whether ArcelorMittal's connection to Uttam Galva Steels Limited, an entity with an NPA, and Numetal's connection to Rewant Ruia, related to the promoter of ESIL, rendered them ineligible.

After executing sale deeds, APIIC issued show-cause notices for cancellation due to non-establishment of units, later demanding 50% of the prevailing market value for condoning the delay. The respondents challenged APIIC's power to cancel allotments or demand additional payment after the sale deeds were executed.","The High Court held that once a sale deed is executed, the allotment conditions or covenants of the sale agreement cannot be enforced, citing the Transfer of Property Act, Indian Contract Act, Registration Act, and Specific Relief Act. The court reasoned that the contract is concluded upon execution of the registered sale deed, resulting in the transfer of title, and the allotment letter or sale agreement does not survive. The doctrine of proportionality was also applied, deeming the cancellation disproportionate.","The writ appeals were dismissed, affirming the judgment of the learned Single Judge, meaning the High Court ruled in favor of the respondents and against the APIIC's demand for 50% of the prevailing market value."

1. The present appeals are concerned with Section 238A of the Insolvency and B","B.K. Educational Services Pvt Ltd appealed against the decision regarding the applicability of the Limitation Act, 1963 to applications made under Section 7 and/or Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically for the period between its commencement on 01.12.2016 and 06.06.2018. The Appellate Authority had previously held that the Limitation Act, 1963 did not apply to such applications during that period.","The core issue revolves around the interpretation and applicability of Section 238A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, which incorporates the Limitation Act, 1963. The appellants argued for retrospective application of Section 238A, citing the Insolvency Law Committee's report and principles of procedural law. The respondents contended that the Code is a complete code and the Limitation Act should not apply, also arguing against retrospective application as it would affect vested rights.",The document does not state the final outcome of the appeals (whether they were allowed or dismissed). It only mentions that the Tribunal's order was set aside and the matter was remanded for a hearing on all points other than the point of limitation.

1. Leave granted.
2. Roma locuta est; causa finita est. Rome has spoken, the cause is ended. Rome spoke through her
laws. One of the pillars of Roman law is contained in the maxim res judicata pro veritate accipi","Canara Bank and N.G. Subbaraya Setty were in dispute over an assignment deed for the trademark ""EENADU"" related to agarbathies (incense sticks), where the bank unilaterally cancelled the deed. Setty challenged the cancellation, while the bank claimed the deed was vitiated by mistake, undue influence, and fraud. The core issue revolves around the validity of the assignment deed and the bank's right to cancel it.","The judgment primarily focuses on the doctrine of res judicata and its exceptions, particularly whether a prior erroneous judgment on a question of law can operate as res judicata. The court examines whether the earlier judgment sanctioning an illegal act (entering into an assignment deed that the bank was prohibited from doing under the Banking Regulation Act) should be binding. The judgment cites various precedents and legal maxims related to res judicata, including Roman law principles and Indian interpretations.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the High Court's order and holding that the earlier judgment declaring the cancellation of the assignment deed illegal could not operate as res judicata because it sanctioned something illegal under the Banking Regulation Act. The suits filed by the respondents were dismissed."

The petitioner claimed that these MAFs are circumventing regulations through arrangements with Indian Chartered Accountancy Firms (ICAFs), violating FDI policy, and engaging in unethical practices like fee sharing.","The case primarily revolves around the interpretation and enforcement of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, specifically Section 21, and related regulations concerning the Code of Professional Conduct for Chartered Accountants. The court considered reports from ICAI study groups and expert groups which highlighted concerns about MAFs violating Sections 25 and 29 of the CA Act, the Code of Ethics prohibiting advertisement and fee sharing, and FDI policy.

                      ","Chitra Sharma and others, representing home buyers, filed a writ petition against Union of India and others, including Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) and Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL), concerning delays in possession of homes in projects floated by JIL. The home buyers' grievance was that the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) did not adequately protect their interests as stakeholders, particularly in light of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016.","The petitioners argued that Sections 6, 7, 10, 14, and 53 of the IBC were ultra vires as they only recognized financial and operational creditors, disregarding home buyers. They contended that the rights conferred upon them by the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and RERA could not be divested, and the moratorium under Section 14(1)(a) would leave them without a remedy. Section 238 of the IBC, which gives it overriding effect over other laws, was also a point of contention.","The court issued interim directions to protect the interests of the home buyers, including appointing a senior counsel to participate in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) meetings and directing JAL to deposit a sum of Rs 2,000 crores. The final outcome of the writ petition is not available in this excerpt."

Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1. This appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 01.09.2009 passed by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as “the National
Commission”), at New Delhi in First Appeal No. 93 of 2004 whereby the National Commission
allowed the appeal filed by respondent No.1 and set aside the order dated 19.01.2004 of the State
Commission, West Bengal, Kolkata in Complaint Case No.698/O/1997.
2. In order to appreciate the issue involved in the appeal, it is necessary to set out the relevant facts
hereinbelow.
3. The appellant was the opposite party No.1 whereas the respondent No.1 herein was the
complainant and respondent No.2 herein was the opposite party No.2 in the complaint out of which
this appeal arises.
4. The appellant is a doctor by profession and is practicing in Calcutt","Dr. S.K. Jhunjhunwala, a surgeon, appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order awarding compensation to Mrs. Dhanwanti Kaur for alleged negligence during a gall bladder surgery. Mrs. Kaur claimed she consented only to laparoscopic surgery but underwent open surgery, which she alleged was negligently performed, leading to further health issues. The case revolves around medical negligence and deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act.","The court relied on the Bolam test, established in Bolam vs. Friern Hospital Management Committee, and Jacob Mathew vs. State of Punjab, to determine medical negligence. The Bolam test states that a doctor is not negligent if they acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical professionals skilled in that particular art. The court emphasized that a doctor is only liable if they lacked the requisite skill or failed to exercise reasonable competence.","The appeal was allowed, and the National Commission's order was set aside, restoring the State Commission's order dismissing the complaint. Thus, Dr. Jhunjhunwala was found not negligent."

Jhunjhunwala appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's (NCDRC) order that held him negligent in performing gall bladder surgery on Mrs. Dhanwanti Kumar. Mrs. Kumar filed a complaint alleging negligence because the doctor performed open surgery instead of the agreed-upon laparoscopic surgery and she suffered post-operative complications. She sought compensation for the resulting loss, mental suffering, and pain.","The court referred to the principle established in Bolam vs. Friern Hospital Management Committee, stating that a professional is not negligent if they exercise the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent person in that profession. The court analyzed whether the doctor's actions fell below the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent surgeon, considering the circumstances and the patient's consent.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the NCDRC's order, restoring the State Commission's order which had dismissed the complaint, effectively finding Dr. Jhunjhunwala not negligent."

1. A writ petition, by way of a Public Interest Litigation, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India, assails the constitutional validity of Section 21A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The
aforesaid section was introduced into the Banking Regulation Act by the Banking Laws
(Amendment) Act of 1983 with effect from 15.2.1984. Section 21A of the Banking Regulation Act
reads as under:
“21A. Rates of interest charged by banking companies not to be subject to scrutiny by
courts Notwithstanding anything contained in the Usurious","Jayant Verma and others filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, challenging the constitutional validity of Section 21A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The petitioners argued that Section 21A, which prevents courts from reopening loan transactions between banks and debtors on the grounds of excessive interest rates, contributes to farmer suicides due to usurious lending practices. The PIL seeks the abolition of Section 21A, particularly as it applies to rural indebtedness.","The case revolves around the interpretation of Entry 45, List I (Union List) relating to 'banking' and Entry 30, List II (State List) concerning 'money-lending and money-lenders; relief of agricultural indebtedness' of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The respondents argued that Section 21A falls under the Union List's purview of banking, thus overriding any conflicting State legislation. The petitioners contended that the State has exclusive domain over relief of agricultural indebtedness, and Section 21A infringes upon this.",Not available in document

A dispute arose when the buyer failed to pay for a consignment, and ECGC offered only 79.5% compensation instead of the agreed 90%. The core issue revolves around the currency exchange rate to be applied when calculating the compensation, specifically whether it should be the rate at the time of shipment or the rate at the time of payment.","The court analyzed Section 25 and 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding the execution of awards. The court considered Clause 17 of the insurance contract, which explicitly provided for the rule for calculating the rate of conversion. The NCDRC's order was based on the interpretation of Clause 17, stating that the insurance claim should be paid as per the conversion rate at the time of shipment.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the NCDRC's order and holding that the currency conversion rate should be applied as per the terms of the insurance contract, which stipulated the rate at the time of shipment."

These review petitions have been filed seeking review of the judgment dated 13.02.2018 of this
Court by which civil appeals were dismissed.
2. The Civil Appeal Nos. 23512-23513 of 2017 had been filed challenging the order dated 13.07.2017
passed by Larger Bench of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter
referred to as “NCDRC”) holding consumer disputes to be non- arbitrable. Prayer was also made to
set aside the subsequent order dated 28.08.2017 passed by Single Member of the NCDRC
dismissing the application filed under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
(hereinafter referred to as “1996 Act”) by ","M/S Emaar Mgf Land Limited, a real estate developer, and Aftab Singh, a buyer, are in dispute over a villa allotment in Mohali. Singh filed a complaint with the NCDRC seeking possession, adjustment of excess payments, penalty for delay, refund, and compensation for deficiency in service. Emaar sought to refer the matter to arbitration based on a clause in the buyer's agreement, which was contested by Singh.","The core issue is whether an arbitration clause in a buyer's agreement can override the jurisdiction of consumer fora under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, especially considering the amendments to Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The appellant argued that the amended Section 8 mandates referral to arbitration, citing precedents interpreting similar language in Section 11(6A). The NCDRC and the respondent contended that the Consumer Protection Act provides an additional remedy and that consumer disputes are not necessarily arbitrable under Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act.","The review petitions were filed against the dismissal of the civil appeals. The document does not explicitly state the final outcome of the review petitions, but it implies that the core issue of arbitrability of consumer disputes remains contested."

Applications for intervention/impleadment are allowed. Application for amendment of grounds of
appeal in Civil Appeal No.10854 of 2016 allowed.
2. These matters are being decided by one judgment since they all arise out of one original
application filed by Shri Tanaji Balasaheb Gambhire (hereinafter referred to as ‘the original
applicant’) before the National Green Tribunal (‘t","M/S. Goel Ganga Developers India Pvt. Ltd. is appealing an order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding violations of Environmental Clearance (EC) for a construction project. The original applicant, Shri Tanaji Balasaheb Gambhire, claimed the developer raised construction in violation of EC and municipal laws. The dispute centers on the interpretation of 'built-up area' in relation to environmental regulations and whether the developer exceeded the permitted construction area.","The core legal issue revolves around the interpretation of 'built-up area' as defined in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, and its relation to Floor Space Index (FSI) under the Development Control Rules (DCR) for Pune Municipal Corporation. The project proponent argues that 'built-up area' is synonymous with FSI, excluding non-FSI areas, while the opposing view asserts that 'built-up area' encompasses all constructed areas, regardless of FSI exemptions. The court is analyzing the DCR, specifically Rules 2.13, 2.39, and 15.4.2, to determine the correct interpretation.",Not available in document

The judgment dated 2nd December, 2014 given by the High Court of Karnataka in writ petitions
filed by the appellant herein is the subject matter of detailed debate and arguments in the present
proceedings, because of the reason that the dispute in question has evoked considerable
con","M/S. Nandhini Deluxe, a restaurant chain, and M/S. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Ltd., a milk producer, are in dispute over the use of the trademark 'NANDHINI'. The milk producer, using 'NANDINI' since 1985, opposed the restaurant's registration of 'NANDHINI' for its foodstuff, arguing deceptive similarity and potential confusion among the public. The respondent claims exclusive rights due to the brand's established reputation.","The case involves Sections 9, 11, 12, and 18 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, concerning the registration of trademarks and relative grounds for refusal. The respondent argued that the appellant's mark was deceptively similar and likely to cause confusion, infringing on their established trademark. The Deputy Registrar initially dismissed the objections, but the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) later allowed the respondent's appeal, a decision upheld by the High Court.","The High Court dismissed the writ petitions filed by M/S. Nandhini Deluxe, thereby confirming the order of the IPAB and accepting the plea of M/S. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Ltd."

2. These appeals are directed against the final Judgment and Order dated 09.02.2015 passed by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Lucknow (hereinafter
referred to as ‘the National Commission’) in First Appeal No. 194 of 2011 ","M/S. Paramount Digital Color Lab, a partnership of unemployed graduates, purchased an 'Agfa Minilab D-Lab. 1 Allrounder' machine from M/S. Agfa India Pvt. Ltd. for their photography business. The appellants alleged that the machine was defective and did not perform as promised, leading to financial loss. The dispute centers on whether the appellants qualify as 'consumers' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, focusing on the definition of 'consumer' and the exclusion for 'commercial purpose' with the exception of 'self-employment'. The court interpreted that if goods are purchased for earning a livelihood through self-employment, the purchaser qualifies as a consumer, even if the activity has a commercial aspect. The court cited Madan Kumar Singh (Dead) v. District Magistrate, Sultanpur and Ors., (2009) 9 SCC 79 to support the interpretation of self-employment.","The document is truncated, so the final outcome is not available. However, the court is considering whether the appellants qualify as consumers under the Consumer Protection Act."

Ltd. before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) regarding the rejection of their insurance claim. The claim arose from damage to their factory due to floods, but the insurance company rejected it due to delayed intimation of the loss, violating Clause 6 of the insurance policy. The appellant alleged deficiency in service and unfair trade practices.",The court analyzed whether the insurance company waived its right to reject the claim due to delayed intimation by appointing a surveyor. The court referred to precedents such as *Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Parvesh Chander Chadha* and *State of Punjab Versus Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar and Others* to establish that waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. The court found no evidence of intentional relinquishment by the insurer.,"The appeals were dismissed, upholding the NCDRC's decision that the insurance company did not waive its right to reject the claim due to the insured's failure to provide timely intimation of the loss."

   CIVIL APPEAL N","Rajasthan Cylinders and Containers Limited and other LPG cylinder suppliers appealed against the Competition Appellate Tribunal's (COMPAT) order, which upheld the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) finding that they engaged in cartelization by rigging prices of LPG cylinders supplied to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL). The main grievance was the imposition of penalties for violating the Competition Act, 2002.","The case primarily concerns Section 3(3)(d) and Section 3(3)(a) of the Competition Act, 2002, which prohibits agreements that directly or indirectly result in bid rigging or price fixing. The CCI and COMPAT found evidence of a collusive agreement among the LPG cylinder manufacturers to submit identical or near-identical bids in response to IOCL tenders, thereby influencing prices and restricting competition. The court examined the Director General's report, which highlighted patterns of identical pricing, meetings among manufacturers, and allocation of territories.",The document only describes the background of the case and the findings of the lower courts (CCI and COMPAT).

R.F. NARIMAN, J.
1. The present appeals revolve around whether Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,
2016, which provides for a moratorium for the limited period mentioned in the Code, on admission
of an insolvency petition","The State Bank of India (SBI) appealed against a decision that extended the moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to V. Ramakrishnan, the personal guarantor of a corporate debtor (Respondent No. 2). SBI sought to proceed against Ramakrishnan under the SARFAESI Act for outstanding debts of the corporate debtor. The dispute centered on whether the moratorium imposed on the corporate debtor's insolvency proceedings should also apply to the personal guarantor's assets.","The court analyzed Section 14 of the IBC, which provides for a moratorium on the institution or continuation of suits against the corporate debtor. The court considered arguments based on Section 128 of the Indian Contract Act, which states that a surety's liability is distinct from the principal debtor's. The court also examined Part III of the IBC, specifically Sections 96 and 101, which contain separate moratorium provisions for personal guarantors, and the Amendment Ordinance dated 06.06.2018, clarifying that the moratorium should not extend to the assets of personal guarantors.",Not available in document

The central question is whether it is mandatory to appoint a judicial member (Judge of a High Court) as the Chairperson of these commissions, or whether the provision allowing such appointment is discretionary. The Utility Users Welfare Association and other consumers/activists are arguing for the mandatory appointment of a judge to protect consumer interests.","The court analyzes Section 84(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically the use of the word ""may"" in relation to appointing a Judge of a High Court as Chairperson of the State Commission. The core issue is whether ""may"" should be interpreted as ""shall,"" making the appointment of a judicial member mandatory. The court also considers the functions of the State Commissions and the importance of having a judicial mind presiding over them.",Not available in document

1. The present appeal1 is from the judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta2. The
appellant, who is a builder, instituted a suit for specific performance of a development agreement,
agai","The case involves a dispute between a builder (Sushil Kumar Agarwal) and the owners of a property (Meenakshi Sadhu & Ors.) regarding a development agreement. The builder sued for specific performance of the agreement, which the owners denied executing. The suit was dismissed by the City Civil Court, and the dismissal was upheld by the High Court.","The primary legal issue is whether Section 14(3)(c) of the Specific Relief Act 1963 bars a developer from suing for specific performance of a development agreement. The lower courts relied on this section, particularly the requirement that the defendant (owner) must have obtained possession of the land. The Supreme Court considered whether the term 'defendant' should be interpreted narrowly or purposively to include developers.",Not available in document

The State Of Karnataka By Its Chief ... vs State Of Tamil Nadu By Its Chie","This case involves appeals by the States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) against the award passed by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal regarding the allocation and sharing of water from the Cauvery River. The primary dispute centers around the allocation of water resources among these states, with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu being the main adversaries. The other states and the Union Territory feel neglected and discriminated against in the water allocation process.","The judgment primarily deals with the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956, specifically Section 3 regarding the constitution of the Tribunal. It also touches upon Article 363 of the Constitution regarding agreements and treaties. The court interprets the agreements between the states and their status after the States Reorganization Act, 1956, and examines the validity and expiry of these agreements. The judgment analyzes the Tribunal's approach post-1974 and the correctness of the same, focusing on the interpretation of Section 6A of the 1956 Act.",Not available in document

The order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short, ‘NCLAT) dated
September 04, 2018 is the subject matter of challenge in the present proceedings. It is a short order,
which is reproduced herein its entirety.
“Having heard learned counsel for the parties and being satisfied of the grounds shown, six days
delay in preferring the appeal is condoned. I.A. No. 973 of 2018 stands disposed of.
Prima facie case has been ma","The Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited (appellant) and Equipment Conductors and Cables Limited (respondent) are in dispute over unpaid claims for goods and services supplied. The respondent initiated arbitration proceedings, but claims related to Invoice Nos. 1-57 were rejected as time-barred. The respondent then filed a petition under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, which was dismissed by the NCLT, leading to an appeal before the NCLAT.","The judgment analyzes Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, which deals with the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process by an operational creditor. The court emphasizes that the existence of an undisputed debt is a prerequisite for initiating CIRP. The court also refers to Section 8 of IBC, 2016, which deals with insolvency resolution and the obligation of the corporate debtor to respond to a demand notice.",Not available in document

SANJIV KHANNA, J.
1. Delay condoned.
2. Two primary questions, in a way interconnected, dated 14th March, 2016 passed in Siddharth
Chaturvedi Vs. Securities and Exchang","The case involves an appeal against the Adjudicating Officer, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) by Bhavesh Pabari, concerning the quantum of penalty imposed under the SEBI Act. The core dispute revolves around the interpretation of Section 15-J of the SEBI Act, specifically whether the factors listed therein are exhaustive or merely illustrative when determining the penalty amount for violations under Sections 15-A to 15-HA.","The Supreme Court analyzed Sections 15-A to 15-HA and Section 15-J of the SEBI Act, emphasizing the need for harmonious construction to avoid inconsistencies. The court held that Section 15-J provides illustrative, not exhaustive, factors for determining penalties, and that the Adjudicating Officer has discretion beyond those listed. The court also clarified that the explanation to Section 15-J, added in 2017, confirms the Adjudicating Officer's discretion in determining the penalty amount under Sections 15-A to 15-HA, overruling the view in M/s. Roofit Industries Ltd.","The court held that the conditions stipulated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15− J are not exhaustive and in the given facts of a case, there can be circumstances beyond those enumerated by clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15−J which can be taken note of by the Adjudicating Officer while determining the quantum of penalty."

The home buyers allege that despite paying a significant portion of the total consideration (40-100%), they have not received possession of their apartments and face potential forfeiture of their investments due to the builder's financial difficulties and insolvency proceedings.","The judgment refers to Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, under which some consumers approached the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC). It also mentions Section 7 and Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, highlighting the home buyers' concerns about being treated as ordinary financial creditors with low priority in liquidation proceedings and the impact of the moratorium imposed by the NCLT on their rights. The petitioners argued that Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is irrational and violates the rights of the home buyers guaranteed under Article 21.","The provided document is an interim order and does not contain the final outcome of the case.

Leave granted.
1. The present Civil Appeal arises out of execution proceedings initiated by the Respondent –
Complainant from an Order passed by the State Commission in a consumer dispute. The issue
which has arisen for consideration is whether a Revision Petition under Section 21(b) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (herein ",The case involves a consumer dispute between K.A. Nagamani (Respondent/Complainant) and the Karnataka Housing Board (Appellant) regarding the allotment of a flat under a self-financing housing scheme. The complainant alleged deficiency of service and sought compensation after the Board refunded a reduced amount after cancelling the allotment. The core issue is whether a Revision Petition is maintainable before the National Commission against an order passed by the State Commission in execution proceedings.,"The Supreme Court analyzed Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which defines the jurisdiction of the National Commission. The court emphasized that the revisional jurisdiction under Section 21(b) is limited to a 'consumer dispute' filed before the State Commission. The court distinguished between appellate and revisional jurisdiction, stating that a revision petition has a narrower scope than an appeal. The court held that execution proceedings are distinct from the original consumer dispute and therefore, a revision petition against an order in execution proceedings is not maintainable before the National Commission.","The Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court's judgment, ruling that the National Commission lacked jurisdiction to entertain a Revision Petition against an order passed in Execution Proceedings by the State Commission. The appeal was dismissed."

MOHAN M. SHANTANAGOUDAR, J.
1. This appeal arises out of judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(‘National Commission’) dated 25.10.2016 dismissing the Appellant’s Review Application No.
76/2016 against the order dated 1.3.2016 by which the National Commission dismissed the
Appellant’s Consumer Complaint No. 117/2016.
2. The Appellant’s case is that Respondent No. 1/Opposite Party No. 1 had developed two buildings
‘Madhuvan’ with thirty two ‘1 BHK’ flats in colony ‘Shanti Park’ in Thane, Maharashtra. Out of these
the Appellant/complainant trust took possession of 29 flats for provisio","Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust, running Lilavati Hospital, purchased 29 flats from M/S Unique Shanti Developers to provide hostel facilities for its nurses. The flats deteriorated due to poor construction, leading the Trust to file a consumer complaint seeking compensation for losses and reconstruction costs. The core dispute revolves around whether the Trust qualifies as a 'consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, given that the flats were used for employee accommodation.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, defining 'consumer' and excluding purchases for 'commercial purpose'. Citing precedents like Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute, the court emphasized examining the dominant purpose of the purchase. The court determined that providing housing to nurses, while indirectly benefiting the hospital, did not constitute a 'commercial purpose' that would disqualify the Trust from being a consumer.",Not available in document

INDU MALHOTRA, J.
1. The present Civil Appeals arise out of a complaint of medical negligence made by Respondent
Nos. 1 to 3 – the Complainants against the Appellant No.1 – Hospital and Appellant Nos. 2 to 4 –
the Paediatricians and Ophthalmologist Doctors working with the Appellant No.1- Hospital, and
Respondent No.4- the Gynaecologist, before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “National Commission”).
2. The National Commission vide Judgment an","This case involves a claim of medical negligence against Maharaja Agrasen Hospital and its doctors by the parents of Master Rishabh Sharma, who was born prematurely and subsequently developed total blindness due to Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). The complainants allege that the hospital and doctors failed to conduct the mandatory ROP check-up, leading to the child's blindness. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) initially ruled in favor of the complainants.","The judgment focuses on the failure to adhere to standard medical protocols for ROP screening in premature infants. The National Commission found a lack of documentation and procedural details regarding the alleged ROP screening, indicating a failure to meet the expected standard of care. The judgment implicitly applies principles of negligence and deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, holding the hospital and doctors accountable for the resulting harm due to their failure to perform the necessary medical examination.",The National Commission allowed the consumer complaint and held the hospital and doctors guilty of medical negligence. The complainants also filed a Civil Appeal for further enhancement of the compensation awarded by the National Commission.

(Corporate Debtor), which was undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC, 2016.","The core legal questions revolved around whether the High Court could interfere with NCLT orders under Article 226/227 of the Constitution, given the statutory appeal remedy to the NCLAT under the IBC, 2016, and whether the NCLT/NCLAT could inquire into allegations of fraud in IBC proceedings. The arguments involved the interpretation of Section 61 and 238 of IBC, 2016, Section 8A of the MMDR Act, 1957, and Section 3(27) of IBC, 2016 concerning the definition of 'Property'.

1. The present statutory Appeals have been filed und","Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's order in favor of Govindan Raghavan (and Geetu Gidwani Verma in a connected appeal). The dispute arose from the builder's delay in obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and handing over possession of an apartment in the ""Araya Complex"" project. The flat purchaser sought a refund of the deposited amount with interest and compensation due to the delay.","The judgment refers to Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, under which the appeal was filed. The National Commission held clauses in the Apartment Buyer's Agreement to be one-sided and unfair. The rate of interest was fixed in accordance with Rule 15 of the Haryana Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017.","The appeal was dismissed, and the builder was directed to refund the amount deposited by the flat purchaser along with interest as compensation."

The dispute concerns the validity of two sale deeds executed by Tikaram in favor of the appellants, which the respondents (Tikaram's family) claim were for immoral purposes and prejudicial to their joint family interests. The respondents filed two separate suits challenging each sale deed.","The central legal issue is whether the second suit is barred by Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and constructive res judicata. The court analyzes whether the cause of action in the two suits is identical, considering that there were two separate alienations. The court refers to precedents like Coffee Board v.

The plaintiff assails correctness of the order allowing the second appeal of the defendants. By the
impugned order, the High Court set aside the concurrent orders of the courts below decreeing the
plaintiff’s suit for specific performance.
2. The plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance of agreement for sale dated 10.11.1989 with
regard to 2/3 rd of the lands owned by defendants 1 and 2 as Defendant No. 3 declined to sign the
agreement. Rs. 50,000/− was paid as earnest money 12:18:41 IST Reaso","Ravi Setia filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement for sale of land against Madan Lal and others. The plaintiff claimed readiness and willingness to perform his part of the agreement, but the defendants failed to execute the sale deed. The High Court set aside the concurrent orders of the lower courts decreeing the plaintiff's suit.","The court analyzed Section 16 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which requires a plaintiff seeking specific performance to prove continuous readiness and willingness to perform the essential terms of the contract. The court found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate this readiness and willingness, particularly by not depositing the balance consideration within the initially granted time and providing inadequate justification for seeking an extension. The court also cited precedents such as V.S. Palanichamy Chettiar Firm vs. C. Alagappan and Umabai and Another vs. Nilkanth Dhondiba Chavan to support its interpretation of Section 16(c).","The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, finding no infirmity in the order concluding that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to perform his obligations, and dismissed the appeal."

appeal of the insured – respon","Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed a decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) upholding a claim under a life insurance policy. The insured's spouse had failed to disclose a prior life insurance policy in the proposal form, leading Reliance to repudiate the claim after the spouse's death. The respondent, Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod, alleged deficiency in service.","The court analyzed the duty of the proposer to disclose all material facts in the proposal form, referencing Sections 17 and 19 of the Contract Act 1872 and Section 45 of the Insurance Act 1938. It cited precedents like Mithoolal Nayak v LIC and Satwant Kaur Sandhu v New India Assurance Co Ltd to emphasize the proposer's obligation to provide truthful and complete information. The court distinguished between repudiations within and after two years of the policy's effective date, noting that Section 45 requires proof of materiality only after two years.","The appeal was allowed, and the judgments of the NCDRC and SCDRC were set aside, dismissing the consumer complaint. The respondent was directed to return the amount withdrawn pursuant to the interim order."

1. Leave gran","Rojer Mathew filed a case against South Indian Bank Ltd. challenging the constitutional validity of Section 13 (5- A) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, which allows secured creditors to participate in auctions of immovable property if it remains unsold. Mathew argued that this provision violated his rights under Article 300A and Article 14 of the Constitution. The broader issue of restructuring of Tribunals and their independence was also considered by the court.","The judgment primarily focuses on the constitutionality of Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017, which amended provisions of various enactments related to the qualifications, appointment, and service conditions of members and presiding officers of statutory Tribunals. The court also considered the non-implementation of directions issued in previous cases (L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India) regarding the administration of tribunals. The court examined the judicial character of tribunals and the need for their independence from the executive.","The specific outcome of Rojer Mathew's appeal regarding Section 13(5-A) of the SARFAESI Act is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the court kept his petition pending to allow consideration of broader issues concerning restructuring of Tribunals."

1. By this order, we propose to dispose of the prayer for interim reliefs in terms of prayer clauses (c)
and (d) of this writ petition. In terms of prayer clause (c), the petitioner has prayed for grant of bail
in respect of FIRs mentioned therein registered at Police Station Kasna, Gautam Budh Nagar,
Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh and Police Station Economic Offences Wing and at Parliament Street,
New Delhi and all other FIRs that have been lodged against the petitioner in the State of Uttar
Pradesh and State of NCT of Delhi but are not within the knowledge of the petition","Satinder Singh Bhasin, Director of a company involved in the ""Grand Venice"" project (Mall and Commercial Tower), filed a writ petition seeking transfer of investigation of multiple FIRs against him related to the project to the CBI or consolidation of FIRs. The complainants/allottees alleged non-delivery of possession of units, non-completion of the project, and siphoning of funds, with many FIRs registered in both Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.","The judgment primarily addresses interim relief and does not delve into a detailed statutory analysis under the Consumer Protection Act or other specific laws. The court considered precedents regarding the transfer of FIRs and investigation between states, specifically citing *Narinderjit Singh Sahni & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors.* and *State of Punjab & Anr. vs. Rajesh Syal*. The court found the issue of consolidating FIRs and entrusting investigation to one agency debatable.","The court granted interim relief by directing the release of the petitioner on bail in connection with all FIRs related to the ""Grand Venice"" project in both Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Further proceedings were stayed only for FIRs registered in Delhi, while the SIT in Uttar Pradesh continued investigating the Uttar Pradesh FIRs."

KRISHNA MURARI, J.
The appellant purchased a standard fire and special perils policy from the respondent National
Insurance Company Ltd. thereby insuring the risk of loss/damage to the stock of coal and lignite
stored in its factory compound. An additional premium of Rs. 59,200/- was paid by the appellant
company so as to cover the risk of loss of the afores","Saurashtra Chemicals Ltd. sued National Insurance Co. Ltd. after the insurer repudiated their claim for loss of coal and lignite due to spontaneous combustion, despite an insurance policy covering this risk. The insurer argued that the spontaneous combustion didn't result in fire and that the claim intimation was delayed. The appellant approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) seeking compensation for the loss and deficient service.","The Supreme Court considered whether the insurer waived the condition of timely intimation by appointing a surveyor and whether the delay could be a defense when not mentioned in the repudiation letter. The court analyzed precedents like Galada Power and Telecommunication Ltd. and Sonell Clocks and Gifts Ltd., distinguishing the former based on its specific facts. The court ultimately ruled that the insurer's failure to mention the delay in the repudiation letter precluded them from using it as a defense.","The appeal was allowed, and the order of the NCDRC was set aside, meaning the insurance company could not deny the claim based on delayed intimation."

The State argues that such supplies constitute a sale and are therefore taxable, while the club contends that the doctrine of mutuality applies, meaning there is no sale as the club acts as an agent for its members. The main grievance is the State's attempt to levy sales tax on these supplies.","The court examines the definition of ""sale"" under the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994, and Article 366(29-A) of the Constitution of India, along with precedents like C.T.O. v. Young Men’s Indian Association. The central legal question revolves around whether the 46th Amendment to the Constitution overrides the doctrine of mutuality in the context of incorporated clubs providing goods to their members. The court is tasked with determining if the provision of food and beverages by incorporated clubs to its permanent members constitutes a sale liable to sales tax.",Not available in document

Union Of India vs Association Of Unified Telecom Service ... on 24","The case involves a dispute between the Union of India and the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India regarding the definition of gross revenue (AGR) as defined in the license agreement granted to telecom service providers. The core issue is whether certain elements of income, such as dividend income and interest income, should be included in the calculation of AGR for the purpose of determining license fees. The telecom service providers argue that these incomes are non-operational and should be excluded.","The judgment refers to Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, under which licenses were issued. It also mentions Section 14(a)(i) read with Section 14(A)(1) of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997, under which the telecom operators initially filed a petition before the TDSAT. The court's reasoning focuses on interpreting clause 19.1 of the license agreement, specifically the definition of 'Adjusted Gross Revenue' and what constitutes 'Gross Revenue'.","The document is truncated, so the final outcome of the appeals is Not available in document."

1. Leave granted.
2. The facts, in this appeal, are as follows:
(i) A Tenancy Agreement was entered into between the landlord’s predecessor-in-title
(Shree Bajrang Land & Trading Company) and the appellants/tenant on 02.02.2006
in respect of certain godowns and other structures.
(ii) The maximum p","Vidya Drolia and others (appellants/tenants) entered into a tenancy agreement with Shree Bajrang Land & Trading Company, later attorned to Durga Trading Corporation (respondent/landlord), for certain godowns. The dispute arose when the appellants failed to vacate the premises after the expiry of the 10-year tenancy period, leading the respondent to invoke arbitration and file a Section 11 petition for appointment of an arbitrator. The appellants challenged the arbitrability of the dispute, citing a prior Supreme Court judgment.","The court considered Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, focusing on the 'existence' of an arbitration agreement and whether it includes weeding out agreements where the subject matter is incapable of arbitration. The court also analyzed Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, relating to the determination of lease, along with Sections 114 and 114A concerning relief against forfeiture. The court questioned whether the word “existence” would include weeding-out arbitration clauses in agreements which indicate that the subject-matter is incapable of arbitration.",The document does not contain the final outcome of the appeal. The court determined that the question of whether the word “existence” would include weeding-out arbitration clauses in agreements which indicate that the subject-matter is incapable of arbitration needs to be authoritatively decided by a Bench of three learned Judges.

1. The present appeal arises out of an Appellate Tribunal’s judgment rejecting the appellant’s prayer
for directions to the resolution professional to provide all relevant documents including the
insolvency resolution plans in question to members of the suspended Board of Directors of the
corporate debtor in each case so that they may meaningfully partici","Vijay Kumar Jain, a member of the suspended Board of Directors of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd., appealed against a decision denying him access to resolution plans and other documents considered confidential during the corporate insolvency resolution process. The appellant argued that as a participant in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) meetings, he needed these documents to effectively contribute, especially considering potential personal guarantees he might have given for the corporate debtor's debts. The dispute centers on the interpretation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 regarding the rights of suspended Board members to access confidential information during insolvency proceedings.","The court analyzed Sections 24, 25, 29, and 31 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, along with relevant regulations, to determine whether members of the suspended Board of Directors are entitled to receive resolution plans and other confidential documents. Arguments were made based on the interpretation of ""participants"" versus ""committee"" members, the confidentiality requirements under the Code, and the right to challenge resolution plans under Sections 60(5) and 61. The court considered precedents like Mobilox Innovations Private Limited v. Kirusa Software Private Limited regarding the use of Notes on Clauses for statutory interpretation.",Not available in document

The Respondent was initially billed under the wrong tariff code, and the Appellant later raised an additional demand for the past period. The Respondent filed a consumer complaint challenging the additional demand as time-barred.","The court analyzed Section 56 of the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically focusing on the interpretation of ""first due"" in the context of disconnection of electricity supply for default of payment. The court determined that the two-year limitation period under Section 56(2) starts from the date when the bill is first raised, not from the date when a mistake in billing is discovered. The court also considered the effect of the non-obstante clause in Section 56(2).","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome of the appeal.

1. The question involved is whether the respondent−employees are entitled to pension on
completion of 15 years of service as per the State Bank of India Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for
short, “the VRS framed in 2000”).
2. The matter has been referred to larger Bench due to conflict of opinion between the Judges as to
the admissibility of pension under the VRS.
Assistant General Manager State Bank Of ... vs Radhey Shyam Pande","The case involves a dispute between the State Bank of India (SBI) and its employees who opted for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) in 2000. The central issue is whether these employees, having completed 15 years of service, are entitled to pension benefits as per the VRS, despite the bank's later clarification requiring 20 years of pensionable service. The employees argue that the initial VRS terms promised pension after 15 years, and the bank's subsequent actions and rule changes unfairly denied them this benefit.","The court analyzed the SBI's Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) and the SBI Employees’ Pension Fund Rules, particularly Rule 22. The High Courts relied on principles of contract law, specifically Section 17 and 19 of the Contract Act, arguing that the bank's silence about future detrimental amendments to pension rules constituted a form of fraud. The courts also considered Article 14 of the Constitution of India, finding the bank's actions unfair and arbitrary, violating the employees' right to equality.","The appeals involved multiple cases with varying outcomes in lower courts. Ultimately, the Supreme Court had to resolve the conflict of opinion regarding the admissibility of pension under the VRS, but the final outcome of each individual appeal (allowed/dismissed) and specific relief granted is Not available in document."

2 The present appeals arise from a judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal

towards the cost of repair of a helicopter to the respondent. Both the appellant and the respondent

Ltd. appealed a decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which upheld the Madhya Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's (SCDRC) finding of deficiency in service. The dispute arose from the insurance company's repudiation of a claim for damages to a helicopter insured under a Transit Marine Insurance Policy. The State of Madhya Pradesh, the insured, claimed compensation for the cost of repair after the helicopter sustained damage during what they argued was still within the transit period.","The core legal issue revolved around the interpretation of ""ordinary course of transit"" under the Institute Cargo Clauses (ICC) incorporated into the insurance policy. The insurance company argued that the transit ended when the helicopter was stored and assembled in New Delhi, while the insured contended that the transit continued until the helicopter reached its final destination, Bhopal. The court had to determine whether the storage and assembly in New Delhi fell outside the scope of the policy's coverage, effectively terminating the insurance liability.",Not available in document

        CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1098−1106     OF 2020
(@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 26077−26085 ","Canara Bank appealed a decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission regarding a fire at Sreedevi Cold Storage, where farmers had stored their agricultural produce (mainly Byadgi Chilli) which was hypothecated to the bank as security for loans. The insurance company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., repudiated the claim, arguing the fire was not accidental and the farmers were not consumers with privity of contract. The farmers filed claim petitions against the cold store, the Bank, and the insurance company seeking compensation for the loss of their agricultural produce.","The judgment analyzes whether the farmers are 'consumers' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and whether there is privity of contract between the farmers and the insurance company. It also examines the validity of the insurance company's claim that the fire was not accidental and whether the insurance company is liable under the policy. The court considered the tripartite agreement between the farmers, the bank, and the cold store, and the insurance policy taken out by the cold store.","The appeals were related to the order of the National Commission, which had partly allowed the appeal of the insurance company and reduced the interest rate. The Supreme Court heard appeals from the insurance company, the farmers, the cold store, and the bank, but the final outcome of each appeal is not explicitly stated in this excerpt."

1. The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the Division Bench of the Kerala High
Court of 19.7.2019, whereby it was held that Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 1 mandating the District Magistrate
to deliver possession of a secured asset within 30 days, extendable to an aggregate of 60 days upon
reasons recorded in writing, is a directory provision. The High Court held as under:

Bright appealed against the District Collector's order, challenging the Kerala High Court's decision that Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) is directory, not mandatory. The dispute centers on the time limit for the District Magistrate to deliver possession of a secured asset. No specific product or service related to consumer protection is explicitly mentioned; the case revolves around the interpretation of the SARFAESI Act concerning secured assets.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, focusing on whether the time limit for the District Magistrate to take possession of a secured asset is mandatory or directory. The court considered precedents regarding the interpretation of ""shall"" in statutes and the distinction between public and private duties. It emphasized that when a public functionary is required to perform a public function within a time-frame, the same will be held to be directory unless the consequences therefor are specified.",Not available in document

1. This appeal arises from a suit for specific performance that was filed by the appellant against four
defendants who are today represented by the respondents. By an agreement to sell dated 12.06.1980
entered into between the appellant company and P. Nagarathina Mudaliar, P. Gopirathnam, P.
Lavakumar, and P. Basantkumar, the agreement recites:
Schedule hereunder and hereinafter referred to as the Reason: said property,
originally belonged to the Hindu Undivided Family consisting of Sri P. Nagarathina
Mudaliar and his father Sri P. Thiruvengada Mudaliar;
Whereas there was a partial partition in the said family as a result of which, the first
vendor has become the owner of the s","Ferrodous Estates (Pvt.) Ltd. filed a suit for specific performance against P. Gopirathnam and others, seeking to enforce an agreement to sell a property. The appellant alleged that the defendants failed to obtain necessary permissions, specifically under the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1978, hindering the completion of the sale. The main grievance was the defendants' alleged breach of the agreement and attempts to alienate the property to third parties.","The primary legal issue revolved around the applicability of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1978, specifically whether the agreement was void due to exceeding the permissible land ceiling. The court considered Section 4, 6, 7, 11, 17, 19 and 21 of the Act. The Single Judge held that the defendants did not comply with the condition of obtaining permission from the Urban Land Ceiling authorities and that there was no term in the agreement that the sale was subject to the grant of permission by the competent authority under the Urban Land Ceiling Act.","The Single Judge decreed the suit, directing the defendants to execute the sale deed in favor of the plaintiff within two months, failing which the court would execute and register the sale deed. The information about the final outcome of the appeal is not available in the truncated document."

and Regulatory Policies” on April 5, 2018, paragraph 13 of which directed the entities
regulated by RBI
(i) not to deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing
with or settling virtual currencies and (ii) to exit the relationship, if they already have
one, with such individuals/ BAJAJ Date: 2020.03.04 13:32:29 IST Reason:
Internet And Mobile Association Of ... vs Reserve Bank Of India on 4 Mar","The Internet and Mobile Association of India and other petitioners challenged the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) circular and statement prohibiting entities regulated by RBI from dealing with virtual currencies (VCs) or providing services to those dealing with or settling VCs. The petitioners, including crypto asset exchange platforms and traders, argued that the restrictions were unreasonable and sought a direction to allow banks and financial institutions to provide access to banking services for crypto asset transactions. The main grievance was the restriction on access to banking services for businesses involved in crypto assets.","The RBI issued the circular under Section 35A read with Section 36(1)(a) and Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Section 45JA and 45L of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The RBI justified the restrictions based on concerns about consumer protection, market integrity, and money laundering risks associated with virtual currencies. The judgment analyzes the powers conferred to the RBI under these sections to regulate the entities.",Not available in document

(Rajasthan Discoms) appealed against Adani Power Rajasthan Limited (APRL) regarding a dispute over increased tariff under the 'change in law' provisions of their Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The PPA, concerning the supply of electricity, was based on a tariff-based competitive bid process. The main grievance was APRL's claim for compensation due to changes in coal supply policies and the increased cost of imported coal.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and the 'change in law' provisions within it, particularly concerning the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) of 2013 and the SHAKTI Policy. The court also considered the Electricity Act, 2003, specifically Section 63, which pertains to tariff-based competitive bidding. The judgment references the precedent set in *Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and Ors.* regarding the interpretation of 'change in law' events in PPAs.",The Rajasthan Discoms' appeals were against the APTEL's judgment which held APRL entitled to relief under the change in law.

1. This appeal raises a question as to the correct interpretation of Section 14(1)(d) of the Insolvency
and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as “the Code”). The facts necessary to appreciate
the setting in which this question arises are as follows:
i. On 01.11.2007, a Resolution bearing No.6280 was passed by the Maharashtra
Housing and Area Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as ‘the MHADA’)
to execute a joint development agreement with the Corporate Debtor, i.e. Guru
Ashish Construction Private Limited, and Goregaon Siddhart","Mr. Rajendra K. Bhutta, the Interim Resolution Professional for Guru Ashish Construction Private Limited (Corporate Debtor), appealed against MHADA's attempt to terminate a Joint Development Agreement and recover land after the imposition of a moratorium under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The dispute centers on whether MHADA's recovery of the property is prohibited by Section 14(1)(d) of the IBC during the corporate insolvency resolution process. The product/service involved is the redevelopment of tenements.","The court analyzed Section 14(1)(d) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, focusing on the interpretation of ""occupied by or in the possession of the corporate debtor."" The appellant argued that ""occupied by"" refers to physical occupation, while the respondent relied on the MHADA Act to argue that no possession was ever handed over. The court considered arguments regarding the definition of ""property"" under Section 3(27) of the IBC and the duties of the interim resolution professional under Section 18.",Not available in document

The present appeal arises out of the judgment dated 21.07.2015 passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (“National Commission”) dismissing the consumer
complaint (Original Petition No. 48 of 2004) filed by the Appellant herein.
2. The facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows:
2.1 One M/s Shrirang Agro Chemical Pvt. Ltd., having its factory premises in
Tarapur, Thane District, was engaged in the business of manufacturing a chemical
called Cyper Methnic ARORA Date: 2020.02.14 16:47:11 IST Reason:
Acid Chloride (“CMAC”), an intermediate product used in growing cash crops. The
said factory premises had become a sick unit, and was auctioned of","M/S Baspa Organics Limited appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's dismissal of their consumer complaint against United India Insurance Company Ltd. The dispute arose after a fire at Baspa Organics' factory, and the insurance company repudiated the claim, alleging overvaluation of the factory and suppression of the fact that Baspa Organics lacked the necessary license for storing Hexane, a chemical used in their manufacturing process.","The court analyzed the Petroleum Act, 1934, and the Petroleum Rules, 1976, specifically focusing on the licensing requirements for storing petroleum Class A, which includes Hexane. The court interpreted Section 8 of the Petroleum Act, which exempts the need for a license for storing small quantities (less than 30 litres) of petroleum Class A. The court also examined Articles 3 and 7 of the First Schedule to the 1976 Rules, determining their applicability based on the quantity of Hexane stored and whether it was stored in bulk.",Not available in document

The bank's application to reject the plaint was allowed by the trial court, affirmed by the appellate court and the High Court, based on the suit being barred by limitation under the Code of Civil Procedure.","The courts applied Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which prescribes a three-year limitation period for suits where no specific limitation period is provided. The courts determined that the right to sue accrued to the appellant in October 2000, when the alleged excess charges were levied, and the suit filed in February 2005 was therefore time-barred. The Supreme Court referred to Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC, which allows for rejection of a plaint if it appears to be barred by any law, including the law of limitation, citing precedents like Ram Prakash Gupta vs. Rajiv Kumar Gupta & Ors. and Church of Christ Charitable Trust & Educational Charitable Society vs. Ponniamman Educational Trust.",Not available in document

2. The Appellant/Complainant, Nirmala Kothari’s husband, Vinod GEETA AHUJA Ray Kothari was
owner of a Hyundai Elantra vehicle, registration no. RJ36CA 0111, which was insured with the
Insurance Company for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- .
3. The said vehicle met with an accident with a tractor bearing no. HR38K 3216, on 06.06.2010 as a
result of which the Appellant’s husband, Vinod Ray Kothari, who was the owner of the car, and his
daughter died and the vehicle was damaged. The driver of the vehicle, Dharmendra Singh Chauhan
Ni",Nirmala Kothari filed a consumer complaint against United India Insurance Co. Ltd. after her insurance claim for damages to her vehicle and personal accident claim following an accident that killed her husband and daughter was rejected. The insurance company rejected the claim because the driver of the vehicle allegedly did not possess a valid driving license at the time of the accident. The complainant alleged deficiency in service by the insurance company.,"The court considered Section 149(2)(a) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, regarding the insurer's liability when the driver is not duly licensed, citing precedents like *United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Lehru & Ors.* and *Pepsu RTC vs. National Insurance Co.* The court clarified that while the insurer can defend based on an invalid license, the onus is on them to prove the insured was negligent in verifying the license's genuineness or willfully breached policy conditions. The court emphasized that an employer is only expected to verify the license appears genuine on its face and is not required to conduct extensive investigations unless there is reason to suspect its validity.","The appeals were allowed, and the judgment of the National Commission was set aside. The respondent/Insurance Company was held liable to indemnify the appellant."

PRELIMINARY WITH BRIEF OUTLINE Leave granted.
2. The short point calling for determination in these appeals against the common judgment dated
09.06.2016 passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in a batch of appeals is as to whether
the income received by the appellants in foreign exchange, for the services provided by them to
foreign enterprises, qualifies for deduction under Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act, 19611, as
applicable during the respective assessment ye","Ramnath & Co., engaged in providing services to foreign buyers of Indian marine products, claimed deduction under Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for income received in foreign exchange. The Commissioner of Income Tax denied the deduction, arguing that the services were rendered 'in India' and not 'from India'. The dispute centers on whether the services provided by Ramnath & Co. qualify for deduction under Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act.","The core issue revolves around the interpretation of clause (iii) of the Explanation to Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act, 1961, specifically whether the services were rendered 'in India' or 'from India'. The High Court held that Ramnath & Co. acted as marine product procuring agents without expertise used abroad, thus not qualifying as 'services rendered from India'. The judgment analyzes the agreements between Ramnath & Co. and foreign enterprises to determine the nature and location of the services provided.","The High Court allowed the appeals of the revenue, setting aside the orders of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) that had favored Ramnath & Co.'s claim for deduction. Aggrieved, Ramnath & Co. preferred appeals to the Supreme Court."

2. This appeal raises important questions of law pertaining to the interpretation and working of the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2005”).
3. This appeal has been filed by Satish Chander Ahuja, the plaintiff questioning the judgment of
Delhi High Court dated 18.12.2019 in RFA No.381/2019 by which judgment Delhi High Court has
set aside the decree granted in favour of the plaintiff dated 08.04.2019 under Order XII Rule 6 of
Civil Procedure Code, decreeing the suit filed by the plaintiff fo","Satish Chander Ahuja filed a suit against his daughter-in-law, Sneha Ahuja, seeking mandatory and permanent injunction to remove her from his property, claiming she was causing disturbance and he was the sole owner. Sneha Ahuja contested, claiming the property was a shared household under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and she had a right to reside there due to domestic violence. The dispute centers around the interpretation of 'shared household' and the rights of a daughter-in-law under the DV Act in relation to the property rights of the father-in-law.","The judgment primarily focuses on the interpretation and application of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, specifically Section 2(s) defining 'shared household' and Section 19(1)(f) regarding alternate accommodation. The High Court's decision emphasizes the need to consider the rights of the daughter-in-law under the DV Act, even when the father-in-law claims ownership of the property. The court directed the Trial Court to consider whether the daughter-in-law made unambiguous admissions about the father-in-law's ownership and to ensure alternate accommodation is provided if her only defense is her right of residence under the DV Act.","The Supreme Court was hearing an appeal against the High Court's decision. The High Court set aside the Trial Court's decree in favor of the father-in-law and remanded the matter back to the Trial Court for fresh adjudication, directing the Trial Court to consider specific aspects related to the DV Act and the rights of the daughter-in-law."

Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J 1 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission 1
allowed an appeal instituted by the first respondent and set aside the decision of the State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission of Gujarat 2. The State Commission found substance in the
consumer complaint of the appellants and decreed their claim for compensation in the amount of Rs
53,66,877 with interest at 9 percent per annum. In addition, the State Commission awarded Rs
25,000 towards mental agony and Rs 5,000 towards litigation costs. The claim ","Shree Ambica Medical Stores filed a consumer complaint against The Surat People’s Co-operative Bank and New India Assurance Company Limited regarding repudiation of an insurance claim for goods hypothecated to the bank. The appellants claimed that their goods were destroyed in a flood, but the insurer rejected a portion of their claim due to the exclusion of STFI (Storm, Tornado, Flood, and Inundation) perils in one of the insurance policies. The core dispute revolves around whether the exclusion of STFI perils was justified and whether the bank or insurer was deficient in service.","The judgment primarily focuses on the conduct of the parties and principles of estoppel rather than a direct application of specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act. The National Commission considered the Tariff Advisory Committee regulations, which permitted the exclusion of STFI perils at the inception of a policy. The Supreme Court considered arguments related to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority's notification regarding providing material information to the prospect, but ultimately based its decision on the appellant's failure to protest the exclusion of STFI perils and their acceptance of the refunded premium.","The Supreme Court upheld the National Commission's decision, effectively rejecting the consumer complaint. The appeal was dismissed, meaning the appellants received no additional compensation beyond the initial amount paid out by the insurer."

Ltd., an authorized agent for the sale and distribution of lotteries organized by the State of Punjab, filed a writ petition against the Union of India challenging the levy of tax on lotteries under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The petitioner argued that the definition of 'goods' under the Act is unconstitutional and discriminatory, violating Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 301, and 304 of the Constitution of India.","The petitioner contended that lottery is not 'goods' as defined in the Constitution and that including actionable claims within the definition of 'goods' under Section 2(52) of the CGST Act is unconstitutional. They also argued that taxing only lottery, betting, and gambling among all actionable claims is discriminatory. The Additional Solicitor General argued that lottery is 'res extra commercium' and that the definition of goods is in line with a previous Constitution Bench judgment.

The insurance company rejected the claim alleging that Bhilawe had already sold the truck to a third party, Mohammad Iliyas Ansari, prior to the accident. Bhilawe argued that he remained the registered owner and had not fully transferred ownership.","The Supreme Court considered the evidence presented before the District Forum and State Commission, including the registration certificate, insurance policy, and loan repayment records, all of which were in the appellant's name. The court emphasized that the insurance company failed to prove that the appellant had transferred ownership or that the insurance premium was paid by the alleged buyer. The court also noted that the alleged buyer did not object to the appellant receiving the compensation.

2. On 09.06.1997, the husband of the Appellant No.1, who was a surgeon, was travelling in a
mini-bus that was owned by the Rotary Eye Institute, Navsari (the Respondent No. 3 herein) along
with other medical staff of the said Institute. The mini-bus had been driven with excessive speed, as
a result of which at around 8.30 P.M. when the mini-bus was passing through the Gandevi-Navsari
Road, near Kabhar Patiya, the driver of the mini-bus lost control and the vehicle turned turtle. The
husband of Appellant No.1 was seriously injured and ultimately succumbe","Sushilaben Indravadan Gandhi filed a claim for compensation following the death of her husband, Dr. Alpesh Gandhi, who died in a mini-bus accident while traveling with medical staff of Rotary Eye Institute, Navsari. The dispute centers on whether Dr. Gandhi was an employee of the Institute or an independent contractor, which affects the liability of The New India Assurance Company Limited under the insurance policy. The insurance policy covered occupants of the vehicle, but excluded liability for death or injury arising out of and in the course of employment.","The core issue was interpreting the contract between Dr. Gandhi and the Rotary Eye Institute to determine if it was a 'contract of service' (employment) or a 'contract for services' (independent contractor). The High Court had determined it was a contract of service, limiting the insurance company's liability. The Supreme Court needed to determine if Dr. Gandhi was an employee, which would exclude the insurance company's liability based on the policy's terms.",Not available in document

to be rejected and the jud","Indigo Airlines appealed a decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which upheld orders from lower consumer forums directing Indigo to compensate Kalpana Rani Debbarma and others. The dispute arose because the respondents were not allowed to board their flight despite having boarding passes, leading to expenses and inconvenience. The core grievance was deficiency in service by Indigo Airlines.","The judgment analyzes whether the consumer fora correctly applied principles of pleadings and burden of proof in determining deficiency of service. The appellant argued that the respondents failed to prove they reported to the boarding gate in time as per the Conditions of Carriage (CoC), citing Interglobe Aviation Limited vs. N. Satchidanand. The court considered whether the airline fulfilled its obligations, including making announcements and providing assistance, and whether the deficiency in service was related to a contractual obligation.",Not available in document

1. This appeal arises out of the judgment dated 18.11.2008 passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission (‘NCDRC’) in Original Petition No. 59 of 2005. Vide the impugned
judgment, the NCDRC allowed the consumer complaint filed by the Respondent herein, directing
the Appellant to pay Rs. 58,89,400/− to the Respondent, along with interest @ 9% per annum from
01.06.2004 till the date of payment.
2. The brief facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows:
2.1 Respondent herein (Complainant) is a cement manufacturer, having a factory in
Nimbahera, District Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. These factory premis","The Oriental Insurance Company Limited appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)'s order directing them to pay M/s J.K. Cement Works compensation for damage to their coal stock due to heavy rains, which the cement company claimed was covered under their Standard Fire and Special Perils insurance policy. The insurance company repudiated the claim, arguing that the damage was not caused by 'flood' or 'inundation' as defined in the policy.","The Supreme Court analyzed the dictionary meanings of 'flood' and 'inundation', concluding that they are often used synonymously to refer to the overflow of water over land. The court distinguished between different types of floods, including pluvial floods caused by excessive rainfall, and held that the insurance policy's coverage was not restricted to overflowing water bodies. The court also noted that the NCDRC had consistently held that damage caused by heavy rainfall falls within the 'flood and inundation' clause of similar insurance policies.",The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and directed the Oriental Insurance Company Limited to pay the sum awarded by the NCDRC to M/s J.K. Cement Works within eight weeks.

It also considers the scope and nature of the power conferred by Section 67 of the NDPS Act, specifically whether it allows for recording confessions that can be used as substantive evidence.

Importers challenged these restrictions, arguing that they were unauthorized modifications of the EXIM policy and violated their rights.","The importers argued that the notifications were quantitative restrictions under Section 9A of the FTDR Act, requiring an inquiry and satisfaction that imports caused serious injury to domestic industry, following the Safeguard Measures (Quantitative Restrictions) Rules, 2012.

Sharma & Co. regarding compensation for land acquired by the government. The dispute arose from a prior decree where K.C. Sharma & Co. was awarded 87% compensation for land they claimed to have leased from Gaon Sabha, which the Union of India alleged was obtained fraudulently in collusion with an ex-Pradhan.","The court examined whether the judgment awarding compensation to the respondents was obtained by fraud. The appellants argued that there was no valid lease, only a license to remove 'shora' from the land. The court considered evidence regarding the Gaon Sabha's decision to lease the land, the auction process, and the approval by the Dy. Director, Panchayat, concluding that the appellants failed to prove fraud.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed by the Union of India, upholding the High Court's decision that set aside the trial court's decree which had favored the Union of India."

SANJIV KHANNA, J.
This judgment decides the reference to three Judges made vide order dated 28th February, 2019 in
Civil Appeal No. 2402 of 2019 titled Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation,1 as it
doubts the legal ratio expressed in Himangni Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia2 that
landlord-tenant disputes governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property 1 2019 SCC OnLine
SC 358 2 (2017) 10 SCC 706 Act, 1882, are not arbitrable as this would be contrary to public policy.
2","Vidya Drolia and Others appealed against Durga Trading Corporation. The dispute revolves around the arbitrability of landlord-tenant disputes, specifically whether such disputes governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, can be resolved through arbitration or if they fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of public courts. The core issue is whether the legal ratio in Himangni Enterprises, which held such disputes as non-arbitrable, is valid.","The court analyzed the meaning of non-arbitrability and whether the court or the arbitral tribunal should decide the question of non-arbitrability, particularly concerning applications under Sections 8 or 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The judgment refers to precedents like Natraj Studios (P) Ltd. v. Navrang Studios and Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd. to distinguish between rights in rem and rights in personam and their arbitrability.",The judgment does not provide a final outcome on the specific appeal (Vidya Drolia vs Durga Trading Corporation). It focuses on answering the legal issues raised in the reference regarding the arbitrability of landlord-tenant disputes and the jurisdiction to decide on non-arbitrability.

1. The above appeals are filed against the interim orders passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Bombay on 10.10.2019, 17.10.2019 and 13.11.2019. The order dated 08.11.2019 passed by the Debts
Recovery Tribunal-I, Mumbai following the order of the High Court dated 17.10.2019 is also in
challenge in the above appeals. For the sake of convenience, the facts in Commercial Suit No.1034 of
2019, filed by Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. are referred to in this judgment.
1 | Page Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as, ‘Respondent
No.4’) filed Commercial Suit No.1034 of 2019 for recovery of a sum of Rs.479,31,29,113/- along with
interest at the rate of 18 per cent. In a nutshell, the case of Respondent No.4 is ","The case involves appeals filed by depositors (Vinay Kumar Mittal & Ors.) of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. (DHFL) against interim orders restraining DHFL from making payments towards their fixed deposits. The depositors sought preference over debenture holders in repayment, arguing that their deposits should be prioritized.","The Appellants relied on Section 36 and 36 (A) of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 and Section 45 (q) (a) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, arguing for preference in repayment. However, the court noted that the Reserve Bank of India had initiated Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against DHFL under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), imposing a moratorium on proceedings against DHFL. The court directed that the claims of the depositors be considered by the Committee of Creditors and the Administrator without being influenced by the High Court's interim orders.","The appeals were disposed of, with the court declining to interfere with the decision of the Committee of Creditors. The court left it open for the Appellants to raise their concerns before the Committee of Creditors, the Administrator, and if necessary, the NCLT."

buyers, accepting the defence of DLF Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd. and Annabel Builders and
Developers Pvt. Ltd. that there was no deficiency of service on their part in complying with their
contractual obligations and, that despite a delay in handing over the possession of the residential
flats, the purchasers were not entitled to compensation in excess of what was stipulated in the
Apartment Buyers Agreement2. 2 The complaint before the NCDRC was initially instituted by nine
flat buyers. These nine complainants had booked residential flats in a project c","This case involves 339 flat buyers who filed a consumer complaint against DLF Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd. alleging deficiency of service due to delay in handing over possession of residential flats in the 'Westend Heights' project. The flat buyers sought compensation exceeding what was stipulated in the Apartment Buyers Agreement (ABA). The NCDRC dismissed the complaint, leading to appeals before the Supreme Court.","The judgment analyzes whether the flat buyers are entitled to compensation for the delay in possession, considering the terms of the ABA, specifically Clause 11(a) regarding the schedule for possession and force majeure conditions. The court examines whether the compensation stipulated in the ABA is adequate and whether the execution of conveyance deeds by some flat buyers constitutes a waiver of their right to claim further compensation for the delay. Specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act are not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt, but the case revolves around the interpretation and application of the Act concerning deficiency of service.","The NCDRC's dismissal of the complaint was appealed. The final outcome regarding whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed, and the specific relief granted, is not available in the truncated document."

PART A A Factual background 1 The appeal arises from a judgment and order dated 8 October 2020

upheld Clause 2(iii) of the Revised Guidelines on Merchanting Trade Transactions1 dated 23
January 20202 issued by the first respondent, Reserve Bank of India3, in the exercise of its power
under Section 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act 19994.
2 The appellant is the managing director of a firm that ","Akshay N. Patel, managing director of a firm trading in pharmaceuticals and PPE, appealed against the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) guidelines prohibiting Merchanting Trade Transactions (MTT) for goods whose export is banned in India. The ban on PPE exports, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prevented Patel from executing an MTT contract between a Chinese supplier and a US buyer. Patel argued that the RBI's clause violated his constitutional rights to carry on business.","The court conducted a proportionality analysis, examining the legitimacy, suitability, and necessity of the RBI's measure, balancing fundamental rights with state aims. The court considered Article 19(1)(g) regarding the right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business, and Article 14 regarding equality before the law. The court also considered the regulatory role of the RBI under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).",Not available in document

[“SIAC Rules”] can be said to be an order under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 [“Arbitration Act”]; and second, as to whether an order passed under Section 17(2) of the
Arbitration Act in enforcement of the award of an Emergency Arbit","Amazon invested in Future Coupons Pvt. Ltd. (FCPL), which held shares in Future Retail Limited (FRL), with the understanding that this investment would benefit FRL's retail assets. FRL then entered into a transaction with the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani group (Reliance), which Amazon claimed violated their agreements and the rights granted to FCPL. Amazon initiated arbitration proceedings and sought emergency interim relief to prevent the transaction.","The core legal questions were whether an Emergency Arbitrator's award under SIAC Rules is an order under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and whether an order enforcing that award under Section 17(2) is appealable. The court analyzed the Arbitration Act and related provisions to determine the enforceability and appealability of the Emergency Arbitrator's award.",Not available in document

This Appeal under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) is against a
judgment and final order dated 18 th December 2019 passed by the National Company Law

the Respondents and setting aside an order dated 21 st March 2019 passed by the Adjudicating

Respondent No.2 (Corporate Debtor) under Section 7 of the IBC. The NCLAT held that the said
Petition of the Appellant Bank under Sec","Dena Bank (now Bank of Baroda) appealed against the NCLAT's decision to dismiss their Section 7 IBC petition against C. Shivakumar Reddy and the Corporate Debtor, arguing that the petition was wrongly deemed time-barred. The dispute concerns a term loan and letter of credit facility extended by the bank to the Corporate Debtor, which defaulted on repayment. The bank's grievance is that the NCLAT failed to consider acknowledgements of debt by the Corporate Debtor within the limitation period.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), specifically Section 7, and the Limitation Act. The court considered whether acknowledgements of debt by the Corporate Debtor, such as proposals for One Time Settlement and entries in financial statements, could extend the limitation period for filing a Section 7 petition. The court also examined whether a final judgment and decree from the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) creates a fresh cause of action for initiating IBC proceedings.",Not available in document

The dispute arose when the insurance company filed its written statement 100 days late, and the NCDRC initially condoned the delay.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, particularly concerning the time limit for filing a written statement. The court considered the Constitution Bench's judgment in New India Assurance Company Limited v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private Limited, which established a strict 45-day limit. However, the court also acknowledged that this judgment was to operate prospectively and considered prior conflicting decisions and directions given during the pendency of the reference to the Constitution Bench.",Not available in document

The parties involved are the Union of India, various States/Union Territories, and migrant laborers represented by intervenors. The main grievance was the lack of adequate support, transportation, food, and social security for migrant workers who lost their employment and were stranded away from their native places.","The court considered the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979; the Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996; and the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. The court emphasized the responsibility of the States/Union Territories to ensure the effective implementation of policies and schemes designed to benefit migrant laborers. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 was also relevant, particularly regarding the withdrawal of prosecutions against migrant laborers for violating lockdown measures.","The court issued a series of directions to the Central Government, States, and Union Territories to provide transportation, food (dry ration and community kitchens), and information regarding available schemes to migrant laborers. The court also directed the establishment of counseling centers and the maintenance of data on migrant laborers to facilitate the extension of benefits."

The respondents, Charanjit Kaur, Kamlesh, and D.K. Khanna, filed complaints seeking conversion of their properties from leasehold to freehold. Their grievance was that conversion was allowed on a pick and choose basis rather than on a consistent policy.","The appellant argued that the conversion fee was not for services but for granting complete title, thus the allottees are not consumers under the Consumer Protection Act. The court examined Section 3 of the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, and the Chandigarh Lease Hold of Sites and Building Rules, 1973, along with the Chandigarh Conversion of Residential Leasehold Land Tenure into Freehold Land Tenure Rules, 1996, to determine the nature of the conversion process and the applicability of consumer protection laws.

     H.2   The Constitutional Scheme of Article 254 and ","The Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) filed a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (WB-HIRA). The FPCE argues that WB-HIRA conflicts with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), a central enactment, and that WB-HIRA did not receive Presidential assent as required under Article 254(2) of the Constitution. The dispute centers on the regulation of the real estate sector and the potential inconsistency between state and central laws.","The court's analysis focuses on the legislative competence of the State of West Bengal to enact WB-HIRA, considering Entries 6 and 7 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The court examines the constitutional scheme of Article 254 regarding repugnancy between state and central laws. It also considers the meaning of phrases like ""is in addition to and not in derogation of any other law"" and ""law for the time being in force"" in the context of RERA and WB-HIRA. The lack of Presidential Assent for WB-HIRA is a key point of contention.",Not available in document

Ltd., the Appellant-Developer, challenged the judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which directed a refund to apartment buyers in the ""The Corridors"" project in Gurgaon due to inordinate delays in construction and obtaining the Occupation Certificate. The apartment buyers' main grievance was the significant delay in receiving possession of their apartments as promised.","The judgment references Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, under which the appeals were filed. The court considered the terms of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement, particularly clauses related to possession, delays, and payment schedules. The court's interpretation focused on whether the developer's delay constituted a deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act.",Not available in document

S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
1. The appellants challenge the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(“the NCDRC”)1 which upheld the concurrent rejection of their application seeking relief.
2. The undisputed facts are that the appellants contracted with the respondent (hereinafter referred
to as “the insurer”), and secured a medical insurance policy (hereinafter referred to as “Mediclaim”),
for the first time in 1982. The policy was annual and was renewed successively, each year by the
appellants by paying the appropriate premium - the last renewal policy forming the subject matter
of the present appeal. The policy renewed by the appellants on 28.03.2007 was in force for a year
i.e., till 27.03.2008. ","Jacob Punnen and his wife appealed against United India Insurance Co. Ltd. regarding a medical insurance claim. The appellants had a Mediclaim policy with the insurer that was renewed annually. The dispute arose when the insurer partially paid a claim for angioplasty, citing a new policy term limiting coverage, which the appellants claimed they were unaware of.","The judgment analyzes whether the insurer had a duty to inform the insured about changes in the policy terms upon renewal. The appellants relied on precedents like Biman Krishna Bose v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai Gajera, arguing that renewal implies existing terms bind the parties. The insurer cited IRDA guidelines to argue no obligation to intimate changes upon renewal.",Not available in document

           CIVIL APPEAL NO.3131   of 2020","This case involves multiple appeals and writ petitions challenging the Maharashtra State Reservation Act of 2018, which granted reservation to the Maratha community. The main dispute revolves around the validity of the Act, particularly the quantum of reservation exceeding the 50% limit and the constitutional validity of the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act, 2018. The core issue is whether the Maratha community qualifies for reservation as a socially and educationally backward class and whether the state government has the power to enact such legislation.","The judgment primarily deals with the interpretation of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution of India concerning special provisions for socially and educationally backward classes and reservation in favor of backward class citizens. It also examines the impact of the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act, 2018 on the state legislature's power to determine socially and economically backward classes. The court considers the Indra Sawhney judgment and whether it needs to be revisited in light of subsequent constitutional amendments and changed social dynamics.","The provided text does not contain the final outcome of the appeals and writ petitions.

The dispute arose because the insurance company only approved a fraction of the claimed amount, based on the surveyor's assessment. Khatema Fibres appealed, contesting the surveyor's method of assessing the loss and the resulting compensation offered.","The judgment refers to Section 64UM(2) of the Insurance Act, 1938, regarding the appointment of surveyors. The court considered precedents related to the deference given to surveyor reports in insurance claims, including United India Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Roshan Lal Oil Mills Ltd., Sikka Papers Limited vs. National Insurance Company Limited, and New India Assurance Company Limited vs. Luxra Enterprises Private Limited. The court found that the surveyor's decision to use volumetric analysis was justified due to discrepancies in the appellant's stock records.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the National Commission's judgment that confined the compensation payable to the amount assessed by the final surveyor."

Indira Banerjee, J.
This appeal, under Section 125 of the Electricity Act 2003, is against a judgment and order dated 27
th April 2021 passed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, hereinafter referred to, in short, as
‘APTEL’, dismissing Appeal No.77 of 2018 filed by the Appellant, Maharashtra State Electricity
Distribution Company Ltd., and affirming an order dated 16th November, 2017 passed by the
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, hereinafter referred to, in short, as 18:05:35 IST
‘MERC’, whereby MERC dismissed the petition filed by the Appellant under Section 86 of the
Electricity Act, being Case ","The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (Appellant) appealed against the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's (MERC) order, which rejected the Appellant's claim that the RBI's introduction of the Base Rate and Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate systems constituted a 'Change in Law'. The Appellant sought to alter the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) rate payable to Power Generating Companies under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The dispute revolves around the interpretation of 'Change in Law' clauses within the PPAs for bulk electricity supply.","The appeal was filed under Section 125 of the Electricity Act 2003. The core issue was whether the RBI's changes in lending rate systems qualified as a 'Change in Law' as defined in Article 13.1.1 (Stage 1 PPAs) and Article 10.1.1 (Stage 2 PPAs) of the Power Purchase Agreements. The judgment analyzes the definitions of 'Change in Law', 'Law', and 'Indian Governmental Instrumentality' within the PPAs to determine if the RBI's actions triggered the clauses.","The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) dismissed the Appellant's appeal, affirming the MERC's order. Therefore, the Appellant's contention that the RBI's actions constituted a 'Change in Law' was rejected."

Sig","The petitioners, primarily real estate allottees and money lenders, challenged Sections 3, 4, and 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act 2020, arguing against the new thresholds imposed for initiating corporate insolvency resolution processes. The main grievance stems from the increased requirements for allottees to jointly file applications under Section 7, potentially hindering their ability to trigger insolvency proceedings against corporate debtors. The case involves real estate projects and financial debts related to them.","The court examined the amendments to Section 7(1) (initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process), Section 11 (persons not entitled to make application), and the insertion of Section 32A (liability of a corporate debtor for an offence committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The analysis focused on the implications of the new provisos in Section 7(1) regarding the minimum number of financial creditors or allottees required to jointly file an application. The judgment discusses the purpose and structure of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.",Not available in document

INDU MALHOTRA, J.
1 This case raises interesting issues with respect to the application of the doctrine of separability of
an arbitration agreement from the underlying substantive contract in which it is embedded; whether
an arbitration agreement would be non-existent in law, invalid or un-enforceable, if the underlying
contract was not stamped as per the relevant Stamp Act; and, whether allegations of fraudulent
invocation of the bank guarantee furnished under the substantive contract, would be an arbitrable
dispute. 1.1 The Respondent No.1-Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (“Indo Unique”) applied for grant of work
of beneficiation/washing of coal to the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (“KPCL”) in an open
tender. KPCL awarded the Work Order vide letter of Award No.A1M1B3/Washed Coal/1052 dated","M/s N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Indo Unique Flame Ltd. are in dispute over the invocation of a bank guarantee furnished by Global Mercantile under a work order with Indo Unique. The dispute arose after Indo Unique's bank guarantee with KPCL was invoked, leading Indo Unique to invoke the guarantee provided by Global Mercantile. Global Mercantile challenged the invocation, claiming it was fraudulent and not in terms of the work order.","The judgment primarily addresses the validity of an arbitration agreement within an unstamped contract, referencing the doctrine of separability and kompetenz-kompetenz. It discusses whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable even if the underlying contract is unstamped and unenforceable under the Stamp Act. The court also considers whether allegations of fraudulent invocation of a bank guarantee are arbitrable.","The High Court held that the arbitration agreement was valid and the dispute was arbitrable, setting aside the Commercial Court's order. Global Mercantile appealed this decision to the Supreme Court."

This appeal under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to
as the IBC) is against the final judgment and order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal
(NCLAT), New Delhi in Company Application (AT)(Insolvency) No. 1064 of 2020 dated 08-03-
2021, whereby the NCLAT has been pleased to dismiss the appeal of the Appellant and confirmed
the order dated 23.10.2020 of the Adjudicating Authority, i.e., the National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLT), New Delhi, dismissing the petition being CP(IB) No. 908/ND/2020, filed by the Ap","M/S Orator Marketing Pvt. Ltd., the assignee of a debt, filed a petition under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against M/S Samtex Desinz Pvt. Ltd. seeking initiation of the Corporate Resolution Process. The dispute centers on whether the loan given by the original lender, Sameer Sales Private Limited, to Samtex Desinz, free of interest, qualifies Orator Marketing as a 'Financial Creditor' under the IBC.","The court analyzed Section 5(8) of the IBC, which defines 'financial debt' as a debt along with interest, if any, disbursed against the consideration for the time value of money. The NCLT and NCLAT relied on precedents stating that the applicant must establish that the loan was given against consideration for the time value of money and that the corporate debtor accepted the component of interest. Since the loan agreement explicitly stated a NIL interest rate, the court concluded that the loan did not qualify as a 'financial debt'.","The Supreme Court upheld the NCLAT's decision, dismissing the appeal and confirming that M/S Orator Marketing Pvt. Ltd. is not a 'Financial Creditor' and therefore ineligible to file an application under Section 7 of the IBC."

1. Challenging an Order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short
“National Commission”), dismissing their consumer complaint on the ground that there was no
deficiency in service on the part of the licensee (electricity distribution company), the consumer of
electricity has come up with the above statutory appeal.
2. We have heard Sh. K.C. Mittal, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Arun Bhardwaj, learned
Additional Advocate General for the State of Haryana, appearing for the respondents.
3. The appellant is carrying on the business of manufacturing cotton yarn in Panipat, Haryana. The
appellant is having a L.S. connection, which got extended from 404.517 KW to 765 KW with C.D 449
KVA to 850 KVA, on 3","M/S Prem Cottex, a cotton yarn manufacturer, appealed against Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam's demand for Rs. 1,35,06,585 due to a wrongly recorded multiply factor in their electricity bills for a period of over three years. Prem Cottex argued that the demand was a result of the electricity company's negligence and was barred by Section 56 of the Electricity Act, 2003, which limits recovery of dues after two years.","The court analyzed Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003, and the precedent set in *Assistant Engineer (D1), Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam limited and Anr. vs. Rahamatullah Khan alias Rahamjulla*. While *Rahamatullah Khan* held that Section 56(2) only barred disconnection, this court interpreted Section 56(2) as barring both recovery and disconnection after two years. However, the court also considered whether raising an additional demand constitutes a 'deficiency in service' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The appeal was dismissed, with the court holding that the raising of an additional demand due to a short assessment does not constitute a deficiency in service, thus the consumer forum lacked jurisdiction to address the complaint."

1. This appeal arises out of order and judgement of the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter ‘National Commission’) dated
24.04.2009 (hereinafter ‘Impugned Order’), allowing Revision Petition No. 331 of
2007 filed by the Respondent No.1 herein, Himachal Pradesh State Forest

Himachal Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Shimla

2. The facts leading to this appeal are as follows: Om Prakash (hereinafter ‘deceased’) was an
employee of Respondent No.1− HPSFC posted as a Ch","Narbada Devi and others, legal heirs of a deceased employee of H.P. State Forest Corporation (HPSFC), filed a consumer complaint seeking insurance claim under a Janta Personal Accident Insurance Scheme. The Insurance Company repudiated the claim, arguing the death was due to alcohol consumption and not an accident. The dispute centers around whether the death qualifies as an 'accidental death' under the insurance policy and whether the Insurance Company is liable to pay the insurance amount.","The court analyzed the terms of the Insurance Policy, specifically focusing on the requirement that the death must result solely and directly from an accident caused by outward, violent, and visible means. The court relied on the Post-Mortem Report and expert opinions indicating the cause of death was asphyxiation due to alcohol consumption and regurgitation, concluding the death was not accidental. The court also considered the exclusion clause in the Insurance Policy regarding death under the influence of intoxicating liquor.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the National Commission's order that the Insurance Company was not liable to indemnify the insured as the death was not accidental."

factory owned by respondent No.1 was charged in favour of respondent No.2 as
security, while the stock in trade was hypothecated in favour of respondent No.3

dues, they are arrayed as ","National Insurance Company appealed against the NCDRC's order to compensate M/s. Hareshwar Enterprises for losses due to a fire in their factory, which was insured by National Insurance. The insured claimed for the destruction of plant, machinery, raw materials, and finished goods. The dispute centered around the assessment of the loss, particularly regarding the stock-in-trade, and the insurer's delay in settling the claim.","The court analyzed Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding the limitation period for filing a complaint. Citing precedents like State Bank of India vs. B.S. Agriculture Industries and Kandimalla Raghavaiah and Company vs. National Insurance Company, the court clarified that the 'cause of action' is not limited to the date of the incident (fire) but extends to the insurer's actions, such as appointing investigators and corresponding with the insured. The court also considered Section 64-UM(2) of the Insurance Act, 1938 regarding the role and importance of surveyor reports.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the NCDRC's order to compensate M/s. Hareshwar Enterprises, finding that the complaint was filed within the limitation period and the NCDRC's consideration of the claim on merits was justified."

The NCLT had rejected NSEL's claim as a creditor against Dunar Foods Limited in insolvency proceedings. NSEL's claim stemmed from alleged siphoning of funds by PD Agro to Dunar Foods, where NSEL was owed money by PD Agro.","The core issue revolved around Section 61(2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which limits the Appellate Tribunal's power to condone delays to a maximum of 15 days beyond the initial 30-day period for filing an appeal. The appellant argued for the Supreme Court to exercise its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to condone the delay, citing precedents where this power was used in similar situations. However, the respondent argued that the statute explicitly limits the condonation period, and the court cannot override this statutory provision, relying on precedents like *New India Assurance Company Limited v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private Limited*.",Not available in document

2 This appeal arises from a judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission1
dated 20 September 2019.
3 In 2012, the appellant floated a group housing project at Sector 89, Gurgaon. An advertisement
was issued, inviting prospective flat buyers. The respondent submitted an application on 14 March
2012 for the allotment of a dwelling unit in the project described as “NBCC Heights”. The terms and
conditions for allotment were set out in a standard form. Instalments towards the purchase price
were payable under a time-linked plan. An allotment letter was issued to th","NBCC (India) Limited appealed against the NCDRC's order to compensate Shri Ram Trivedi for delayed possession of a dwelling unit in a group housing project. Trivedi filed a consumer complaint due to the delay in handing over possession of the unit, despite making payments as per the time-linked plan. The core dispute revolves around the interpretation of the allotment letter's clause regarding the timeline for handing over possession and the adequacy of the compensation offered by the builder.","The court analyzed Clause 20 of the allotment letter, particularly the term 'endeavour' regarding the completion timeline, interpreting it as requiring reasonable effort from the builder, not indefinite discretion. The court cited *Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited v. Govindan Raghavan* and *Wg. Cdr. Arifur Rahman Khan and Aleya Sultana & Ors. v. DLF Southern Homes Pvt Ltd* to support the view that one-sided clauses in builder-buyer agreements constitute unfair trade practices under Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and that consumer forums have the jurisdiction under Section 14(1)(e) to direct removal of deficiency in service and provide compensation.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the NCDRC's direction to pay compensation at 10% per annum on the deposited amount from June 2015 until the actual date of possession, along with Rs 2,00,000 for loss of rent and Rs 25,000 for costs."

                                        ","Prakash Gupta, director and promoter of Ideal Hotels & Industries Limited, appealed against the rejection of his application for compounding an offence under Section 24(1) of the SEBI Act. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) initiated proceedings against Gupta for alleged violations related to the company's IPO in 1995, specifically price rigging and insider trading. Gupta sought compounding under Section 24A of the SEBI Act, which was denied by the Trial Judge and affirmed by the High Court due to SEBI's objection and the advanced stage of the trial.","The judgment analyzes Section 24A of the SEBI Act regarding compounding of offences. It discusses SEBI circulars related to Section 24A and the jurisprudential basis for compounding, both within and outside the CrPC. The court also considers the regulatory role of SEBI and provides guidelines for compounding under Section 24A, taking into account precedents like JIK Industries Limited vs Amarlal v. Jumani.",Not available in document

1. These petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India are filed in representative capacity, to
espouse the cause of teachers having B.Ed. (Special) and D.Ed. (Special) degree/diploma courses
and fully trained to cater to the requirements of Children/Child with Special Needs1 also known as
Divyang, including to impart 1 for short, “CwSN” them education and make them independent. The
thrust of the grievance in the writ petition(s) is about the illegality being committed by the
concerned State and its Authorities in employing them in recognised schools on contract basis
without any certainty ","The case involves writ petitions filed by teachers with B.Ed. (Special) and D.Ed. (Special) degrees/diplomas, representing teachers trained to educate Children with Special Needs (CwSN). The petitioners allege that the State of Uttar Pradesh and other authorities are illegally employing them on contract basis without certainty of tenure, failing to maintain the required pupil-teacher ratio for CwSN. The petitioners seek a mandamus directing the respondents to ensure free and compulsory education to CwSN by appointing special teachers as per the required teacher-pupil ratio and creating/reserving posts for them in schools.","The judgment refers to Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (specifically Sections 2(m), 16, and 17), the Rights of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and Article 21A of the Constitution. The court emphasizes the statutory obligation to provide inclusive education and the right to education for children with special needs. The court interprets these provisions to require the State to take specific measures to promote and facilitate inclusive education, ensuring that students with disabilities are not kept away from the mainstream of education.","The document is an interim order and does not contain a final decision. The court directs the State of Uttar Pradesh to file an affidavit detailing how it will implement the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, by providing inclusive education, and to address equality and non-discrimination as per Section 3 of the Act."

Leave granted.
2. The appellants, Ram Manohar Lohia Joint Hospital and two others, have filed this appeal taking
exception to the order and judgment dated 15.11.2018 whereby Lucknow Bench of the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad has upheld the order dated 20.01.2010 passed by the Labour Court,
Lucknow directing reinstatement of the first respondent herein, namely, Munna Prasad Saini along
with compensation of Rs.20,000/- (rupees twenty thousand only) for the period of unemployment","Ram Manohar Lohia Joint Hospital appealed against the High Court's decision to uphold the Labour Court's order for reinstatement and compensation to Munna Prasad Saini, a ward boy, claiming he was not their employee but rather a contractual worker. The dispute centers around whether Saini was an employee of the hospital or Bombay Intelligence Security (I) Ltd., and the legality of his termination.","The Labour Court relied on attendance registers, duty charts, and other documents obtained under the RTI Act to determine the employer-employee relationship. The Supreme Court considered the appellant's arguments regarding contractual employment and the applicability of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, but ultimately deferred to the factual findings of the Labour Court. While the termination violated Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the court cited precedents like *Deputy Executive Engineer v. Kuberbhai Kanjibhai* and *Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Bhurumal* to justify awarding compensation instead of reinstatement, considering Saini's contractual status.","The appeal was partly allowed; the direction for reinstatement was set aside, and a lump sum compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- was awarded to Munna Prasad Saini."

1.Heard Shri Manjeet Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant and also Shri Samar Vijay
Singh, learned AAG for the respondent. By the impugned judgment the High Court has interfered
with the award passed by the Labour Court, Hisar dated 13th October, 2006 and directed that
appellant would be entitled to lump sum compensation of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five
Thousand Only) which was to be paid within three months of the order. The High Court notes the
claim of the appellant to be that he was appointed verbally in June, 1983, and that, his service was
terminated on verbal orders on 01.04.1991, after he had worked for eight years.
2. The case of the appellant was that he was working with the respondent for a period of nearly eight
years an","Ranbir Singh, the appellant, claimed his services were terminated by Executive Eng.P.W.D. without complying with Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, after working for eight years. The Labour Court initially awarded reinstatement with back wages, but the High Court reduced it to a lump sum compensation. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement.","The court considered precedents regarding the termination of daily wagers and the applicability of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act. It noted conflicting judgments, including those emphasizing compliance with Section 25F and those suggesting compensation instead of reinstatement for daily wagers terminated due to procedural defects. The court ultimately favored the line of decisions that allows for compensation in lieu of reinstatement, especially when there's no evidence of unfair labor practices or retention of junior workers.","The appeal was partly allowed, modifying the High Court's judgment to increase the compensation amount to Rs. 3.25 lakhs, inclusive of the Rs. 25,000 already paid, as a full and final settlement."

the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.65,74,000/- with interest @9% p.a. from the date of filing of
complaint till realization. The appellant was also directed to pay Rs.25,000/- as cost to the
complainant.
2. The appellant herein is a testing, inspection and certification company that tests the quality and
quantity of several Jayant Kumar Arora products. The complainant engaged the appellant for
providing services for inspection of groundnut procured by the","SGS India Ltd., a testing and certification company, was engaged by Dolphin International Ltd. to inspect groundnuts for export to Greece and the Netherlands. Dolphin International alleged deficiency in service because the groundnuts, upon arrival, did not meet the specifications certified by SGS India regarding aflatoxin levels and peanut size, leading to financial losses for Dolphin International.","The judgment analyzes whether SGS India was deficient in its service under the Consumer Protection Act, considering the scope of its inspection and certification responsibilities. The court considered arguments regarding the impact of external factors like weather and storage on aflatoxin levels and peanut size during transit, and whether SGS India's disclaimer absolved them of responsibility after shipment. The court also considered the argument of adverse inference due to the appellant not sharing the report of its counterpart in Greece.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, and dismissed the complaint filed by Dolphin International."

The agreement obligated SK Wheels to provide premises for TCS to conduct examinations. The dispute arose when TCS issued a termination notice, which SK Wheels challenged, leading to proceedings before the NCLT and NCLAT.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), specifically Sections 14 and 25, concerning the moratorium and the duties of the Resolution Professional (RP) to maintain the Corporate Debtor as a going concern. The court considered whether the NCLT could stay the termination of a contract under Section 60(5)(c) of the IBC and whether Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act 1963, regarding determinable contracts, was applicable.

                          ","The State of Goa appealed against a High Court judgment that quashed an order regarding the reservation of wards for municipal council elections. The dispute centered on the timing and legality of the election process, specifically the notification for reservation of wards and the subsequent election schedule. The respondent, Fouziya Imtiaz Shaikh, challenged the order, alleging irregularities in the reservation process, particularly concerning women's representation.","The arguments revolved around Articles 243T, 243ZA, and 243ZG of the Constitution of India, along with Sections 9, 10, and 22 of the Goa Municipalities Act. The appellant argued that Article 243ZG(a) barred court interference in electoral matters, citing *Meghraj Kothari v. Delimitation Commission*. They also invoked Article 243ZG(b) and numerous precedents like *N.P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer* to assert judicial restraint once the election schedule is notified. The court considered the constitutional bar on interference in electoral matters and the timing of the challenges relative to the election process.",Not available in document

1. The international awakening to further the rights and equal opportunities to persons with special
abilities (hereinafter referred to as ‘PWD’) propelled the adoption of the Proclamation on the Full
Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region in the meeting
of the member states of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific held in Beijing
in December, 1992; to which India was a signatory. In furtherance of its international commitments,
The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Particip","The State of Kerala appealed a High Court order granting Leesamma Joseph, a person with a disability appointed on compassionate grounds, promotion benefits under the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The dispute centers on whether reservation in promotion applies to individuals appointed on compassionate grounds and whether the 1995 Act mandates such reservations.","The court examined Sections 32 and 33 of the 1995 Act, which pertain to the identification and reservation of posts for persons with disabilities. The Tribunal initially interpreted these sections as not providing for reservation in promotion, limiting reservation to direct recruitment. The High Court, however, relied on subsequent Supreme Court judgments like Rajeev Kumar Gupta and Siddaraju, which affirmed the applicability of reservation in promotions for persons with disabilities, distinguishing the Indra Sawhney case.","The Supreme Court granted leave to examine the legal issue but declined to interfere with the High Court's order granting financial benefits to the respondent, as she had already retired. The court appointed an Amicus Curiae to assist in the examination of the legal question."

The dispute arose from the implementation of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, and specifically concerns the restriction on rectifying errors in Form GSTR-3B as per Circular No. 26/26/2017−GST. Bharti Airtel claimed it had surplus Input Tax Credit (ITC) but was unable to utilize it due to the non-functionality of GSTR-2A.","The judgment analyzes notifications and circulars issued under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017, specifically focusing on Rule 61 and related notifications concerning the filing and rectification of Form GSTR-3B. The court examined the validity and interpretation of Circular No. 26/26/2017−GST, particularly paragraph 4, which restricted the rectification of Form GSTR−3B. The court considered the impact of the non-operational GSTR-2A on the ability of registered persons to claim ITC.",The appeal filed by the Union of India was related to the High Court's decision to allow Bharti Airtel to rectify Form GSTR-3B; the final outcome of the appeal (allowed/dismissed) is not available in the provided document.

The dispute arose from notifications restricting the import of these goods under the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992, and the importers' reliance on interim orders to import them. The Union of India contends that the goods are liable to absolute confiscation.","The judgment references the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and the Customs Act, 1962.

Statutory Provisi","The Union of India appealed against a judgment concerning the refund of unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC) under the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017. The dispute centers on whether 'Net ITC' for refund calculations should include input services, particularly in cases of inverted duty structure where the tax rate on inputs is higher than on output supplies. VKC Footsteps India Pvt Ltd. and other assessees argued that excluding input services from the ITC calculation is ultra vires Section 54(3) of the CGST Act and discriminatory.","The court analyzed Section 54(3) of the CGST Act, which allows for a refund of unutilized ITC in specific cases, including inverted duty structures. The core issue revolved around the interpretation of 'Net ITC' as defined in Rule 89(5) of the CGST Rules, specifically whether it should encompass input services or be limited to inputs. The court examined the legislative intent behind Section 54(3) and the validity of Rule 89(5) in light of Section 164 of the CGST Act, which grants rule-making power.",Not available in document

1. Counsel for parties were heard, with their consent, for final disposal of the appeal. The appellant
(hereby “insurer”) questions the judgment and order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi1 (""hereafter the NCDRC""). In the impugned order, the NCDRC dismissed
the appellant’s revision petition, that challenged the order2 of the Rajasthan State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Bikaner (hereafter “the State Commission”).
2. The respondent-complainant obtained an insurance policy3 from the insurer for his Bolero car,
somewhere in Punjab, though he was a resident of Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. T","United India Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against Sushil Kumar Godara after the NCDRC upheld the State Commission's order directing the insurer to pay the insured amount for a stolen Bolero car. The insurance company had repudiated the claim due to the expiry of the vehicle's temporary registration, delayed intimation of theft, and the vehicle being left unattended. The core dispute revolves around whether the insurance company was justified in repudiating the claim based on the vehicle's expired temporary registration at the time of the theft.","The court relied on Section 39 and 192 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the precedent set in *Narinder Singh Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.*, which established that driving a vehicle without valid registration constitutes a fundamental breach of the insurance policy. The court interpreted that even though the vehicle was stolen while parked, the act of driving it to that location after the temporary registration expired was a violation, justifying the insurer's repudiation. The NCDRC was faulted for disregarding this binding precedent.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the NCDRC's order and effectively ruling in favor of the United India Insurance Co. Ltd., thus upholding the repudiation of the insurance claim."

The dispute arose after ECGC rejected the insurance claim of Mokul Shriram EPC JV, which had obtained insurance policies for a contract awarded by the Government of Basra, Iraq, for construction work, after the contract was withdrawn due to internal conflict and payments were suspended.","The central issue was whether the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or the 1986 Act applied to the appeal, specifically concerning the deposit required for filing an appeal. The court analyzed Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, and Section 107 of the 2019 Act, along with precedents like Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, to determine if the right to appeal under the 1986 Act had accrued before the 2019 Act came into force and whether the new deposit requirements could be applied retrospectively.","The document is an interim order dealing with an application regarding the applicability of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 or 2019. The final outcome of the appeal is not available in the provided document."

The consumer booked an apartment in Windchants, Gurgaon, and alleged deficiency in service due to the delay.","The Supreme Court considered the interplay between the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, holding that they operate harmoniously.

The court affirmed the Commission's power to direct refunds under Section 14 of the Act.","The Supreme Court upheld the Commission's order, directing the developer to refund the amount paid by the consumer with interest for the delay in delivering the apartment."

The disputes arose under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, where MSEs sought recourse through the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Councils for recovery of dues.

The court examined whether the MSMED Act overrides the Arbitration Act when an independent arbitration agreement exists between the parties. It also analyzed whether the Facilitation Council can act as an arbitrator after conducting conciliation proceedings, considering the bar in Section 80 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.","Leave to appeal was granted in SLP(C) No. 12884/2020, SLP(C) No. 31227/2018, SLP(C) No. 7375/2020, SLP(C) No. 2135/2021 and SLP(C) No. 6166/2021.

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned final judgment and order dated 03.08.2021
passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi in Revision Petition
No. 2898/2015, by which, the appellant is denied the relief of settling the claim under Reason:
herein has preferred the present appeal.
2. That the appellant herein – original complainant was the registered owner of the Truck bearing
No. CG−04−JC−4984. The said vehicle was insured with the respondent herein – insurance
company for the period from 22.08.2012 to 21.08.2013. The appellant also paid a sum of Rs.
28,880/− to the respondent towards premium. On 23−24.03.2013 in the midnight, the said vehicle
was stolen. A FIR was immediately lodged in the Police Station Kumhari, which was registered as
FIR No. 57/13. On the same ","Gurmel Singh, the appellant, filed a consumer complaint against National Insurance Co. Ltd. after his insured truck was stolen and the insurance company refused to settle the claim due to the non-submission of the original or duplicate registration certificate, which he couldn't obtain because the RTO had locked the details due to the theft report. The appellant argued that the insurance company's refusal to settle the claim despite providing a photocopy of the registration certificate and registration particulars from the RTO constituted a deficiency in service.","The judgment emphasizes that insurance companies should not be overly technical and refuse claims on flimsy grounds, especially when the insured is unable to produce documents due to circumstances beyond their control. The court implicitly applies the principles of fairness and reasonableness inherent in consumer protection law, finding that the insurance company acted arbitrarily by demanding a document the appellant couldn't obtain. No specific sections of the Consumer Protection Act or precedents are explicitly cited, but the ruling reflects the Act's objective of protecting consumers from unfair trade practices and deficiency in service.","The appeal was allowed, the orders of the lower courts were set aside, and the insurance company was directed to pay the appellant the insurance amount of Rs. 12 lakhs with 7% interest from the date of claim submission, along with litigation costs of Rs. 25,000."

1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants are defendant 1(a), defendant 1(b) and second defendant in a Suit filed for specific
performance. Defendant 1(a) and Defendant 1(b) have filed SLP(C)No.6858/2017 while defendant
No.2 has filed SLP(C)No.6857/2017. The Trial Court while refusing specific performance, directed
the return of the amount paid by the plaintiff under the contract. By the Reason:
impugned judgment, the High Court allowed the plaintiffs appeal and directed the
appellants to execute the sale deed relating to the plaint schedule pro","The case involves a dispute over specific performance of an agreement to sell a site allotted by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). The original plaintiff, Y. Subba Raju, sought specific performance against the first defendant, G.T. Girish, based on an agreement entered in 1982. The defendants contested the maintainability of the suit and the validity of the agreement, arguing it violated restrictions on alienation imposed by the BDA.","The appellants argued that the agreement was unlawful under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as it violated the BDA's rules prohibiting alienation of the site for ten years. They cited the Bangalore Rules of Allotment, 1972, specifically Rule 18(2), and precedents like Kedar Nath Motani v. Prahlad Rai and Narayanamma v. Govindappa. The High Court, however, found the second defendant was not a bonafide purchaser and the alienation was hit by Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.",Not available in document

M.R. SHAH, J.
1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned interim order passed by the High Court of

Judge of the High Court has stayed order dated 9.12.2021 passed by the National Consumer

petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, in which the respondent herein
challenged the judgment and order passed by the National Commission in First Appeal No.
250/2021, the original respondent before the High Court has preferred the present appeal.

by a detailed order dated 31.03.2022, the learned Single Judge of the Hi","Ibrat Faizan, the appellant, booked a flat in a project by Omaxe Buildhome Pvt. Ltd., the respondent. The dispute arose because the possession of the flat was not handed over despite payment of the sale consideration, leading to a consumer complaint filed by the appellant alleging deficiency of service and unfair trade practice. The core issue is whether a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is maintainable against an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in an appeal under Section 58(1)(a)(iii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.","The court analyzed Sections 58 and 67 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, to determine if a further appeal to the Supreme Court is available against an order of the National Commission passed in an appeal from a State Commission's order. The court considered whether the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India could be invoked in such a scenario, especially when Section 67 only provides for appeals to the Supreme Court against orders made by the National Commission under specific clauses of Section 58(1)(a). The judgment also references previous cases like Associated Cement Companies Limited v. P.N. Sharma and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India.",Not available in document

2. Heard Mr. Avinash Lakhanpal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant. None has
entered appearance on behalf of the respondents though duly served.
3. The precise","Jaina Construction Company appealed against Oriental Insurance Company's repudiation of their insurance claim for a stolen vehicle. The insurance company denied the claim due to a delay in informing them about the theft, despite an immediate FIR being filed. The dispute centers around the interpretation of the insurance policy's condition regarding timely notification of loss.","The Supreme Court relied on the precedent set in Gurshinder Singh vs. Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd., interpreting Condition 1 of the insurance contract. The court distinguished between accidental loss and theft, stating that immediate police notification suffices for theft claims, especially when the police investigation confirms the theft's genuineness. The court emphasized that mere delay in informing the insurer, when the police were promptly notified, does not justify claim denial.",Not available in document

The court referred to the Seetharam Rice Mill's case, emphasizing a purposive interpretation of Section 126 to restrict unauthorized electricity use.

learned National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai (hereinafter referred to as “NCLT”), whereby the
application filed by the appellant under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016
(“IBC” for short) was admitted. The learned NCLAT while allowing the appeal held that the

3. During the period between the years 1993 – 1994, Ind Bank Housing Limited (hereinafter
referred to as “IBHL”) sancti","Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMBL) appealed against a decision by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that reversed the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) admission of KMBL's application under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against A. Balakrishnan & Anr. The dispute concerns the initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against the Corporate Debtor, with the NCLAT holding that the application was time-barred.","The core legal issue revolves around whether the issuance of a Recovery Certificate under the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 triggers a fresh right to sue under the IBC. KMBL argued that the Dena Bank case established that a fresh right accrues upon issuance of a Recovery Certificate. The respondents contended that the cause of action merged into the Recovery Certificate, and initiating CIRP would be res judicata. The court also considered arguments regarding whether a decree-holder is a 'financial creditor' under the IBC.",Not available in document

The plaintiffs filed a suit for partition and separate possession, which was initially settled through a compromise in Lok Adalat. However, some plaintiffs later alleged fraud and sought to set aside the compromise, leading to appeals and writ petitions.","The judgment primarily revolves around the validity of a compromise decree passed by the Lok Adalat under Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. The appellants argued that the High Court erred in setting aside the Lok Adalat's order without a reasoned decision, as the Lok Adalat's award is deemed a decree of a Civil Court. The court also considered the principle of approbating and reprobating, questioning whether plaintiffs could rescind the compromise after accepting its benefits.",Not available in document

The informant-appellant, Manoj Kumar Khokhar, is the son of the deceased and alleges that the accused intentionally strangled his father due to pre-existing rivalry and political enmity. The main grievance is that the High Court granted bail without proper reasoning, considering the gravity of the offense and the accused's potential to influence witnesses.","The Supreme Court reviewed the High Court's order granting bail and considered precedents regarding the principles for granting bail, including the nature of the accusations, the evidence, the severity of punishment, the accused's character, and the possibility of tampering with witnesses. The court emphasized that bail should not be granted arbitrarily and that the High Court should provide reasons for its decision.

420 of 2019. It further challenges the Order dated 28.12.2020 in Review Petition No. 682 of 2020.
By the said Judgment in the Writ Petition, the High Court allowed the Writ Petition filed by the first
respondent and quashed the Order 17:24:39 IST Reason: dated 07.07.2018, which was passed by the
appellant, terminating the Power Purchase Agreement (hereinafter referred to as ‘the PPA’, for

appellant was dismissed. Hen","M.P.

Sky Power challenged the termination, and the High Court initially ruled in their favor, which MPPMCL appealed.","The judgment primarily revolves around contractual obligations and the maintainability of a writ petition in a contractual dispute.

A       The Appeal
1       The present appeal under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
2016 1 arises from a ","M/s Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited (Appellant) filed an application under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against M/s Hitro Energy Solutions Private Limited (Respondent) for initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) due to an outstanding operational debt related to a terminated project involving the supply of light fittings. The dispute arose after Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) terminated a project with the Appellant, who had placed orders with the Respondent's proprietary concern for light fittings, and an advance payment of Rs 50,00,000 was made but the fittings were never delivered.","The court considered whether the appellant qualified as an 'operational creditor' under the IBC, even as a purchaser, and whether the respondent had taken over the debt from the proprietary concern. The court also examined whether the application under Section 9 of the IBC was barred by limitation. The judgment refers to sections of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, specifically Section 9 and Section 62, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules 2016.","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) reversed the decision of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), dismissing the application of the appellant under Section 9 of the IBC and releasing the respondent from the ongoing CIRP; this Supreme Court appeal is against the NCLAT order."

The dispute centers on whether a Lok Adalat award can be the basis for redetermining compensation for land acquired for industrial development.","The core legal question is whether an award passed by a Lok Adalat under Section 20 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, can form the basis for redetermination of compensation under Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The appellant argued that Lok Adalats lack adjudicatory function and their awards are merely compromises, not court determinations as required by Section 28A.

SANJIV KHANNA, J.
The primary legal issue which arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the Depositories Act,
1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and
Participants) Regulations, 1996 1 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the
contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 2 and the common law as applicable in
India. To facilitate analysis, this judgment has been divided into sections as follows:
1 For short, ‘1996 Regulations’.
2 For short, ‘Contract Act’.
        A.     Factual background of the case
        B.     Relevant provisions of the Contract Act
        C.     Analysis of case laws under the Contract Act:
 ","PTC India Financial Services Limited (PIFSL) advanced a loan to NSL Nagapatnam Power and Infratech Limited, secured by a pledge of shares of NSL Energy Ventures Private Limited (NEVPL) held by Mandava Holdings Private Limited (MHPL). When the Corporate Debtor (NNPIL) defaulted, PIFSL invoked the pledge and became the 'beneficial owner' of the shares. The dispute arose during the insolvency resolution process regarding the valuation of the pledged shares and the extent to which PIFSL and MHPL were financial creditors.","The primary legal issue is whether the Depositories Act, 1996, read with Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996, overwrites the provisions relating to contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

K. M. JOSEPH, J.
1. By the impugned order, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
‘NCLAT’ for brevity) has dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant challenging the order passed by
the National Company Law Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as ‘NCLT’ for brevity) dated
28.05.2020. By the said order, the NCLT admitted an application filed by the first respondent under
Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’) Date:
2022.10.13 15:20:37 IST Reason:
against the second respondent. The third respondent was appointed as the Interim
Resolution Professional and a moratorium followed. The appellant is an ex-director
of the second respondent.
2. The question which falls for decision is whether the appellant","Rajratan Babulal Agarwal, an ex-director of Honest Derivativeds Pvt. Ltd. (HDPL), appealed against the admission of an insolvency application filed by Solartex India Pvt. Ltd. against HDPL under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The dispute arose from the supply of allegedly inferior quality Indonesian coal by Solartex to HDPL, which HDPL claimed caused damage to its boilers and production losses.","The central question was whether a 'pre-existing dispute' existed as defined in *Mobilox Innovations Private Limited v. Kirusa Software Private Limited*. The appellant argued that emails exchanged between the parties constituted evidence of a dispute regarding the coal's quality, referencing Sections 12, 41, 42, and 59 of the Sales of Goods Act, 1930, to support the claim that HDPL had the right to examine the goods and claim damages for breach of warranty.",Not available in document

No.414/2019 and Crl.M.A.No.1754/2019 whereby the Delhi High Court dismissed the application
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “Cr.P.C”) for
quashing of the summoning order dated 1.6.2018 and the order framing notice dated 3.11.2018,
issued against the appellant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘N.I. Act’). On the criminal complaint instituted by one Satish Gupta (respondent
no.2), the order under Section 251 of the Cr.P.C. was issued against the appellant by the Magistrate’s
Court. The High Court on conside","Rathish Babu Unnikrishnan appealed against the Delhi High Court's dismissal of his application to quash a summoning order and notice issued against him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint was filed by Satish Gupta (respondent no. 2) regarding a dishonored cheque. The appellant contended that the cheque was a security for a buyback of shares and not a legally enforceable debt.","The Supreme Court considered Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, regarding dishonored cheques and the presumption of a legally enforceable debt under Section 118. The court cited precedents like *M.M.T.C. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Medchl Chemicals and Pharma (P) Ltd. & Anr.* and *Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan* to emphasize the initial presumption favoring the complainant and the burden on the accused to prove the absence of a debt. The court also referred to Section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, regarding share transfers.","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision not to quash the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, allowing the trial court to evaluate the evidence."

2. This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated 12th April 2019 passed by the Single Judge
of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Regular First Appeal No. 1462 of 2012, thereby
allowing the appeal filed by the respondents−defendants herein and setting aside the judgement and

claiming a decree of permanent injunction to restrain the respondents−defendants
from using the trade mark “SAI RENAISSANCE” or any other trade mark identical

Vijaya Sai and others seeking a permanent injunction to restrain them from using the trademark ""SAI RENAISSANCE"" for their hotels, alleging infringement of their registered trademark ""RENAISSANCE"". The plaintiff claimed that the defendants' use of the mark was deceptively similar and created confusion, while the defendants argued that ""RENAISSANCE"" is a generic word and they cater to a different class of customers.","The appellant argued that Sections 29(1), 29(2), and 29(3) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 should apply, as the services are identical or similar. The High Court, however, applied Section 29(4) but only considered clause (c). The Supreme Court analyzed the applicability of Section 29(4) and the concept of 'dilution' of a trademark, considering factors like similarity, reputation, and unfair advantage.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's judgment, and restored the trial court's judgment with modifications, restraining the respondents from using the trademark ""SAI RENAISSANCE"" or any deceptively similar mark."

The housing society claimed that the lack of an occupancy certificate resulted in higher property tax and water charges for its members. The NCDRC dismissed the complaint as barred by limitation and not maintainable.","The court analyzed Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 regarding the limitation period for filing a complaint and Section 22 of the Limitation Act 1963 concerning continuing breaches. The court referred to the precedent in Balakrishna Savalram Pujari Waghmare v. Shree Dhyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan to distinguish between a continuing wrong and the effect of an injury. The court determined that the failure to obtain an occupancy certificate was a continuing wrong, but the claim for refund of excess charges was time-barred.","The appeal was allowed in part, setting aside the NCDRC's order regarding the maintainability of the complaint concerning the failure to obtain an occupancy certificate, but the claim for refund of excess charges was dismissed as time-barred."

The appellant's father was the original tenant, and the dispute arose after the respondent filed a suit for possession. The main grievance is the applicability of the Rajasthan Rent Control Act, 2001 during the pendency of the suit.","The court analyzed Section 1(2), Section 18, and Section 32 of the Rajasthan Rent Control Act, 2001, focusing on the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal and the repeal of the Rajasthan Premises (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1950. The court considered whether the civil court retained jurisdiction after the Rent Control Act became applicable to the area. Precedents like Om Prakash Gupta v. DIG Vijendrapal Gupta, Vineet Kumar v. Mangal Sain Wadhera, Nand Kishore Marwah & Ors. v. Samundri Devi, and Ramesh Chandra v. III Additional District Judge & Ors. were discussed to determine the maintainability of the decree by the civil court.",The appeals were dismissed.

1. The present appeal filed by the appellant− complainant challenges the judgment and order dated 1
st June, 2016, passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as “the Commission”) in Consumer Complaint No.55 of 2006, thereby
holding that the appellant−complainant was not a consumer as envisaged under Section 2(1)(d) of
The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”). As such, by the

maintainable.
2. The facts in the present case are not in dispute. The bare necessary facts for adjudication of the
present appeal are as under:

(hereinafter referred to as “the erstwhile Bank”) in the year 1998. The appellant is a stock−broker by
profession. The appellant had applied for ","Shrikant G. Mantri, a stockbroker, filed a consumer complaint against Punjab National Bank (successor to Nedungadi Bank) alleging deficiency in service related to an overdraft facility and pledged shares. Mantri claimed the bank failed to return shares after the overdraft account was settled, while the bank argued Mantri was not a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act as the services were for a commercial purpose. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) dismissed Mantri's complaint, holding he was not a consumer.","The core issue revolved around the interpretation of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, specifically whether the overdraft facility availed by Mantri constituted a 'commercial purpose' and whether it fell under the exception for services used exclusively for earning a livelihood through self-employment. The court examined the legislative history and object of the Act. The judgment refers to several precedents, including Internet and Mobile Association of India vs. Reserve Bank of India, Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust vs. Unique Shanti Developers and others, Paramount Digital Colour Lab and others vs. AGFA India Private Limited and others, Sunil Kohli and another vs. Purearth Infrastructure Limited, and CBI, AHD, Patna vs. Braj Bhushan Prasad and others.",Not available in document

Commission”) on 07th June 2019 had passed the following order in the Revision Petition No. 483 of
2018 filed by the respondent-SBI.
“The revision petition is allowed. The complaint is dismissed, with liberty to the complainant to
approach a competent civil court as per the law.
It goes without saying that, if the complainant chooses to bring action in a civil court, he is free to
file an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and, in such contingency, the
chronological facts and proceedings in the consumer p","Sunil Kumar Maity filed a consumer complaint against State Bank of India (SBI) and another individual, Sunil Maity, alleging deficiency in service. The complainant's account details were mixed up with another customer having a similar name, resulting in unauthorized withdrawals from his account. The dispute revolves around the bank's negligence in handling the accounts and the resulting financial loss to the complainant.","The court analyzed the revisional jurisdiction of the National Commission under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, emphasizing its limited scope. The court found that the National Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by calling for and relying on a report from SBI at the revisional stage, which the lower fora had no opportunity to consider. The court also cited a precedent (CCI Chambers Coop. Hsg. Society Ltd. vs. Development Credit Bank Ltd.) to reinforce that the complexity of evidence should not bar access to consumer forums if issues can be determined by summary inquiry.","The appeal was allowed, and the order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission was restored, effectively holding SBI liable for the deficiency in service. The specific relief granted (compensation amount, etc.) is not detailed in this judgment excerpt, but the original order of the State Commission is reinstated."

The main grievance is SEBI's refusal to disclose the investigation report under Regulation 9 of the PFUTP Regulations, which Takano argues is crucial for his defense.","The core issue revolves around whether an investigation report under Regulation 9 of the PFUTP Regulations must be disclosed to the person to whom a show cause notice is issued.

Bharat Forge Ltd., a tenderer, filed a writ petition claiming that the tendering process was unfair because bidders quoted different GST rates due to the lack of a specified HSN code in the tender documents, thus creating an uneven playing field. Bharat Forge argued that some bidders were quoting a lower GST rate, giving them an unfair advantage.","The document primarily discusses the interpretation of tender clauses and the duties of the tendering authority, focusing on whether the authority had a statutory duty to clarify the HSN code. The appellant argued that the responsibility for determining and paying the correct GST rate rested with the bidders, and the tender clauses reflected this. The High Court's reliance on the 'level playing field' principle was challenged, with the appellant contending that the High Court overstepped its limits in interfering with contractual matters and imposing duties that should be shouldered by tax authorities.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final outcome of the appeal.

          ","The Union of India appealed against a Gujarat High Court judgment that challenged the constitutionality of notifications imposing Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on ocean freight paid by a foreign seller to a foreign shipping line for goods imported into India on a reverse charge basis. M/s Mohit Minerals Pvt. Ltd., the importer, argued that this levy constitutes double taxation as ocean freight is already included in the value of goods for customs duty.","The judgment analyzes the constitutional architecture of GST, the legislative history of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016, and the nature of the GST Council's recommendations. It examines statutory provisions of the IGST Act, including Sections 5(1), 6(1), 20(iii)-(iv), 11, and 13(9), along with Sections 15(5) and 16(1) of the CGST Act, to determine if the impugned notifications suffer from excessive delegation and if the ocean freight transaction constitutes a valid supply of services under Section 5(3) of the IGST Act. The court also considers whether the importer is the service recipient under CIF contracts and the applicability of Section 5(4) of the IGST Act.",Not available in document

1. The present appeals, by special leave, are directed against orders 1 of the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter “NCDRC”). The NCDRC allowed a revision petition
filed by the respondent corporation.
2. The brief facts of the case are that the appellant, a proprietary concern applied for an industrial
plot of the proposed project on 28-02-1994 in Industrial State Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon. The
respondent corporation (hereinafter “HSIDC”) called the appellant’s proprietor, Modi Lal Gupta, for
an interview 1 Dated 11.01.2007 in RP No.3125/2003 and order dated 07.11.2008 in Misc.
Application No. 711/2008 in",Aman Semi-Conductors (Pvt.) Ltd. appealed against the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)'s order which allowed a revision petition filed by Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (HSIDC). The dispute arose from HSIDC's resumption of an industrial plot allotted to Aman Semi-Conductors due to the latter's failure to construct and commence production within the stipulated time. Aman Semi-Conductors argued that the lack of infrastructure and procedural lapses by HSIDC hindered their progress.,"The court analyzed Clause 6 of the allotment agreement, which stipulated timelines for construction and commencement of production, and the consequences of failing to meet those deadlines. The NCDRC relied on the precedent Indu Kakkad v Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd, where a similar clause was upheld. The court considered arguments regarding violation of natural justice but ultimately found that HSIDC had provided sufficient opportunity to Aman Semi-Conductors to explain their inaction.","The appeals by Aman Semi-Conductors were dismissed, upholding the NCDRC's decision which allowed HSIDC to resume the plot."

       2.                Indian Law has proceeded on the assumption that parents are
       persons who beget a child or who assume the legal obligations of
       parenthood through formal adoption of child. Under the Indian legal
       spectrum, a husband is strongly presumed to be the father of a child
       born to his wife. Thus, there is a strong presumption regarding the
       paternity of a child. This presumption can be overcome only by evidence

Signature Not Verified","This case involves a dispute between Aparna Ajinkya Firodia (appellant) and Ajinkya Arun Firodia (respondent) concerning a divorce petition filed by the husband, where he sought a DNA test for their second child to ascertain paternity, alleging adultery on the wife's part. The husband claimed the child was born out of an adulterous relationship and presented a private DNA test report indicating he was not the biological father.","The court considered Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act regarding the presumption of legitimacy of a child born during a valid marriage. It also referenced the Family Courts Act, 1984, and the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court acknowledged that while Section 112 provides a presumption, it is rebuttable, especially with modern scientific evidence like DNA testing, and cited the precedent of Sharda vs. Dharmpal regarding medical tests in matrimonial disputes.",The Supreme Court was hearing an appeal against the High Court's decision. The High Court dismissed the wife's writ petition and upheld the Family Court's order allowing the husband's application for a DNA test of the child.

1. Leave granted.
2. The present appeal arises from the final judgment and order dated 24.01.2018 passed by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short “the National Commission”), New
Delhi in Revision Petition No. 3415 of 2016. By the said judgment, the National Commission
reversed the concurrent judgments of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Reason:
(for short “the District Forum”) and the State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (for short “the State Commission”). The Fora below, while allowing the
original complaint had directed the New India Assurance Company Limited (for
short “the Insurance Company”) to indemnify the Claimant on non-standard basis to
the extent of ","Ashok Kumar, the appellant, filed a consumer complaint against New India Assurance Co. Ltd., the respondent, regarding the repudiation of his insurance claim for the theft of his truck. The District Forum and State Commission initially ruled in favor of Ashok Kumar, directing the insurance company to indemnify him for 75% of the insured value. The National Commission reversed these decisions, leading to the present appeal before the Supreme Court.","The National Commission relied on Order XXIII Rule 1(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, arguing that the withdrawal of the earlier complaint barred the filing of a fresh complaint on the same subject matter. The National Commission also found a breach of Condition No. 5 of the insurance policy, as the vehicle was left unattended with the keys in the ignition. The judgments of this Court in National Insurance Company Limited vs. Nitin Khandelwal, [(2008) 11 SCC 259] and Amalendu Sahoo vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, [(2010) 4 SCC 536] were discussed in the lower courts regarding the consequences of the breach of policy conditions.",Not available in document

1. The Civil Appeal is directed against the Order passed by the Competition Appellate Tribunal, New
Delhi (hereinafter referred to as ‘Tribunal’), by which Order, the Tribunal affirmed the findings and
conclusion recorded by the Competition Commission of India (hereinafter referred to as ‘CCI’) on
various facets of abuse of dominant position.
dominant position was ascribed to the appellants.
Reason:                                                                         The
          appeal was dismissed.
2. The second respondent had provided information to the CCI which the CCI proceeded to con","Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiary, Western Coalfields Limited, appealed against an order by the Competition Appellate Tribunal, which affirmed the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) finding that they abused their dominant position. The dispute centers around whether CIL, a statutory monopoly created under the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973, is subject to the Competition Act, 2002. The main grievance is that applying the Competition Act would hinder CIL's ability to fulfill its constitutional duty under Article 39(b) to distribute coal equitably for the common good.","The appellants argued that the Nationalization Act, which created a statutory monopoly for coal mining, should take precedence over the Competition Act. They cited Article 39(b) and Article 31C of the Constitution, along with Sections 3 and 11 of the Nationalisation Act, to support their claim that CIL's actions are driven by welfare policies rather than profit motives. The court considered the conflict between the Nationalisation Act's objective of equitable distribution and the Competition Act's aim of ensuring free trade, focusing on whether CIL's actions, even if monopolistic, are justified by its constitutional mandate.",The appeal was dismissed.

The Revenue argued that these designs should be subject to service tax under the category of ""Design Services,"" while Suzlon claimed they are goods and not services, thus not liable for service tax.","The core issue was whether the imported designs and drawings should be classified as ""goods"" or ""services"" under the Finance Act, 1994, specifically Section 65(35b) read with Section 65(105)(zzzzd). The Revenue relied on BSNL v. Union of India to argue the distinction between sale of goods and contract of service. The respondent cited Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v.

Haridasan, the plaintiff, appealed against the High Court's decision to overturn the trial court's decree for specific performance of an agreement to sell land to him by Anappath Parakkattu Vasudevakurup and others, the defendants. The plaintiff had paid an advance but the defendants refused to execute the sale deed, leading to a suit for specific performance or return of the advance with interest. The core dispute revolves around whether the specific performance of the agreement to sell should be enforced.","The judgment primarily focuses on Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, concerning the court's discretion in granting specific performance. The High Court relied on this section to set aside the trial court's decree, arguing that the trial court was not justified in enhancing the sale consideration. The Supreme Court considered whether the High Court erred in reversing the decree of specific performance, especially when the execution of the agreement and receipt of part sale consideration were not disputed.",Not available in document

1. This appeal under section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereafter ‘the C.P. Act’, for
short) calls in question the order dated 21st August, 2020 passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, (hereafter ‘NCDRC’, for short). By the impugned order,
the NCDRC has dismissed the consumer complaint lodged by the appellants.
2. The multiple appellants are owners of flats in different blocks of a housing complex at 1, Kailash
Ghosh Road, Kolkata – 700008 (hereafter ‘housing complex’, for short).
3. Aggrieved by the failure of the respondents - the developers of the housing complex - to provide
services as promised, the jurisdiction of the NCRDC was invoked by the appellants in 2008. They
alleged that despite paying full consideration amount as per market rate and despite execution and
registration","Debashis Sinha and other flat owners in a Kolkata housing complex appealed against M/S R.N.R. Enterprise, the developers, for failing to provide promised services and amenities, including a completion certificate, playground, and community hall. The appellants alleged unfair trade practices and constructional defects, seeking directions for the completion certificate, rectification of defects, provision of amenities, and compensation. The NCDRC dismissed the complaint, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 regarding unfair trade practices and Sections 390, 393, 394, and 403 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980 along with Rule 26 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Buildings Rules, 1990. The court interpreted these provisions to establish that the responsibility for obtaining the completion certificate rested with the developer, not the flat owners. The court found the NCDRC's reasoning that the consumers should have known what they were purchasing to be indefensible and contrary to the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act.",Not available in document

The new owners acquired the properties through auction sales, often on an ""as is where is"" basis, and are challenging the Electric Utilities' refusal to provide connections unless the previous owners' debts are cleared. The core dispute revolves around whether electricity dues constitute a charge on the property, binding subsequent owners.","The judgment analyzes the Electricity Act of 2003, along with the preceding Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, to determine the obligations of electricity suppliers and the rights of consumers. It examines provisions related to the definition of 'consumer,' the obligation to supply electricity, and the power to disconnect supply for non-payment. The court also considers State Electricity Regulatory Commissions' regulations and Electricity Supply Codes concerning the recovery of electricity charges and disconnection policies.","The document does not provide a final outcome for the appeals. It only presents the background, issues, and analysis of the case."

S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
1. There are two appeals preferred against a common order of the National Company Law Appellate
Tribunal (hereinafter, “NCLAT”/“Tribunal”). The first, by the original home buyer’s legal
representative (hereinafter, “complainant”) and the second by the builder / developer (hereinafter,
“developer”).
2. In 1989, one Smt. Gursharan Kaur had applied for a flat in a proposed group housing scheme
called ‘Siddharth Shila Apartments’, situated at Plot No. 24 in Vaishali Scheme, Ghaziabad, U.P.
(hereinafter, “Scheme”). After depositing three instalmen","This case involves a dispute between a home buyer, Dr. Manjeet Kaur Monga (later represented by her legal heirs), and a developer, K.L. Suneja, regarding a flat in a housing scheme. The complainant alleged unfair trade practices due to delayed construction and subsequent cancellation of the allotment after depositing seven installments. The main grievance was the delay in possession and the developer's actions after the complainant resisted further payments due to lack of progress.","The case was initially filed under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (MRTP Act). The COMPAT held the developer guilty of unfair trade practice under Section 36-A (1) (i), (ii) & (ix) of the MRTP Act. The court also relied on the precedent set in Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Ved Prakash Agarwal, clarifying the limits of the MRTP Commission's powers regarding specific performance.","The NCLAT directed the developer to pay further compensation in the form of compound interest @ 15% per annum on the principal amount of Rs.4,53,750/- from 1st May, 2005 until 7th May, 2016, along with pendente lite and future interest until realization of the accumulated arrears."

   ","Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and Adani Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) are in dispute over Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The dispute concerns compensation claimed by APML due to a ""Change in Law"" following revisions in coal supply policies by the government, which impacted APML's fuel costs. MSEDCL contested the method of calculating this compensation.","The judgment analyzes Article 10 of the PPA, specifically concerning ""Change in Law"" and its impact on tariff payments. It also considers the Electricity Act, 2003, and the New Coal Distributional Policy (NCDP) of 2007 and 2013. The court refers to the principle of restitution, aiming to restore the affected party to the same economic position as if the Change in Law had not occurred. The judgment also references a previous case, Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others.","The appeals involved multiple issues related to the calculation of compensation. The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) ruled in favor of APML on key issues such as Station Heat Rate (SHR), Gross Calorific Value (GCV), and the extent of coal supply assurance, leading to MSEDCL's appeal to the Supreme Court."

                                     CIVIL","The Mathura Vrindavan Development Authority and the State of UP appealed against a High Court judgment that quashed demand notices for various charges (external/internal development, inspection, sub-division, stacking, impact fees) levied on Rajesh Sharma and others. The dispute centers on the legality of these charges under the U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, concerning development within the authority's jurisdiction. The main grievance is the imposition of charges beyond those explicitly permitted by the Act.","The court considered Sections 14, 15(2-A), 41 & 59 of the U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, and cited the precedent of *State of U.P. & Others v. Malti Kaul (Smt.) & Another* to uphold the levy of development fees/charges. The court interpreted Section 15(2-A) as limiting the permissible charges to those explicitly mentioned therein. It held that Section 41, while granting supervisory powers to the State, does not authorize the imposition of charges not permitted under Section 15(2-A), and that levying such charges violates Article 265 of the Constitution of India.","The appeals were partially allowed; the levy of development fees/charges was upheld based on the *Malti Kaul* precedent, while the High Court's decision quashing other charges (inspection, sub-division, etc.) was affirmed, except in the case of Rekha Rani where the quashing of development charges was overturned."

Preliminary and brief outline .............................................................................. 2 Particulars of the
proceedings and the parties ................","The case involves appeals against a judgment by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) regarding the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of Appu Hotels Limited. The NCLAT reversed the approval of a resolution plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), finding issues with the process and eligibility of the resolution applicant. The appeals before the Supreme Court concern the validity of the NCLAT's decision to reject the resolution plan and order a fresh CIRP process.","The judgment analyzes several aspects of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and related regulations, including Regulations 27 and 35 concerning valuation, Regulation 36-A regarding publication of Form G, and the effect of Sections 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act and Section 88 of the Trusts Act. It also considers the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and the scope of judicial interference. The judgment does not explicitly mention the Consumer Protection Act.","The document is an interim stage of the case, with the Supreme Court hearing appeals against the NCLAT's decision. The final outcome is not stated in this excerpt, but the Supreme Court is considering whether to uphold or overturn the NCLAT's judgment."

D. A CARRIER, A BAILEE? ...................................","M/s D.N. Singh, a carriage contractor for bitumen, appealed against an order related to income tax assessment for the year 1996-1997. The dispute arose from allegations of misappropriation of bitumen, where the appellant allegedly lifted bitumen from oil companies but did not deliver the full quantity to the Road Construction Department of the Government of Bihar. The core grievance revolves around the addition of a sum to the appellant's income under Section 69A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, due to the alleged short supply of bitumen.","The High Court focused on the scope of Section 69A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, in relation to unexplained money, bullion, etc. The court's analysis involved determining whether the addition to the appellant's income based on the alleged short supply of bitumen was justified under this section.

The Co-operative Society contended that it was also eligible to supply medicines under NAM and that a tender process should have been initiated. The High Court ruled in favor of the Co-operative Society, directing the State of Uttar Pradesh to purchase Ayurvedic medicines through a transparent process after inviting tenders.","The Supreme Court analyzed paragraph 4(vi)(b) of the Operational Guidelines of the National AYUSH Mission (NAM), which stipulates that at least 50% of the grant-in-aid should be used for procuring medicines from IMPCL or other PSUs, pharmacies under State Governments, and cooperatives. The court interpreted the provision to determine whether it mandated a tender process or allowed direct procurement from IMPCL. The court considered arguments regarding state largesse, judicial review of government contracts, and the interpretation of the term 'at least' in the guidelines.",Not available in document

1. Being the second round of litigation before this Court, the issues that arise for consideration in
this appeal fall within a narrow compass.
2. During the year 1994, the appellant, a registered partnership firm, undertook prawn cultivation in
an extent of 100 acres, with a water-spread area of 68 acres, at Vakapadu Village in S. Rayavaram
Mandal of erstwhile Visakhapatnam District. It obtained insurance coverage from the respondent
Insurance Company for a period of five months from 7-10.09.1994 in relation to all the 37 ponds in
its operation, covering 22,67,000 prawns, for a maximum insured value of €.1,20,00,000/-. The
appellant paid a total premium of €.2,44,800/- along with sales tax of €.12,240/- and was issued ","M/S. Isnar Aqua Farms, a prawn cultivator, sought insurance coverage from United India Insurance Co. Ltd. for their prawn cultivation. After a disease outbreak caused mass mortality, the insurance company repudiated the claim, alleging breach of policy conditions regarding record maintenance. The dispute centers on the quantification of the insurance amount payable to the appellant due to the loss of prawns.","The court considered the insurance policy's terms for computing admissible loss, including input cost, unit cost, and fortnightly valuation methods. The court emphasized the principle of uberrima fides (utmost good faith) in insurance contracts, citing General Assurance Society Limited Vs. Chandumull Jain and Jacob Punnen and another Vs. United India Insurance Company Limited. The court found the insurance company's repudiation based on unsubstantiated claims of improper record-keeping to be in violation of this principle.",Not available in document

",M/S Suneja Towers Private Limited is appealing a decision regarding a dispute with Anita Merchant over the failure to deliver possession of three flats booked by her. Anita Merchant alleged deficiency of service after paying 60% of the total sale consideration for the flats in a residential project launched by Suneja Towers. The main grievance is the non-delivery of the flats after the agreed period.,"The State Commission, referencing the case of Dr. Manjeet Kaur Monga v. K.L. Suneja, awarded compound interest to the complainant, which the National Commission upheld. The core legal issue revolves around the legality and validity of awarding compound interest on the refund of the deposited amount, particularly in the context of Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which defines 'consumer'. The Supreme Court considered whether awarding compound interest at 14% was justified.","The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and issued notice limited to the question of awarding compound interest at 14%. The execution of the impugned orders was stayed subject to the appellants depositing a further sum, with the respondent allowed to withdraw the deposited amount with accrued interest, all subject to the final orders of the Court."

Digitally signe",M/S. Tata Motors Ltd. appealed against various Deputy Commissioners of Commercial Taxes across multiple states concerning the levy of sales tax on the replacement of defective parts in automobiles under warranty agreements. The core dispute revolves around whether credit notes issued by manufacturers to dealers for replacing defective parts constitute consideration and are thus subject to sales tax under respective state sales tax enactments. The case involves the interpretation of sales tax laws in the context of warranty obligations in the automobile industry.,"The judgment refers to a Reference Order questioning the correctness of observations made in Mohd. Ekram Khan & Sons vs. CTT regarding credit notes being treated as consideration for replacement parts. The court is tasked with determining whether a credit note issued by a manufacturer to a dealer for replacing a defective part under warranty is subject to sales tax. The analysis involves examining the relationship between the manufacturer, dealer, and customer, and whether the warranty obligation is discharged free of cost.",The document is an interim order referring the matter to a larger bench for consideration; the final outcome of the appeals is not available in this excerpt.

1. This petition seeking leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution is at the
instance of M/s Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited, Original
appellant before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short,
‘the NCDRC’) in the First Appeal No. 376 of 2016 by which the NCDRC dismissed the
appeal filed by the petitioner herein thereby affirming the order passed by the State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, ‘the SCDRC’) of Delhi, holding
that the respondent No. 1 /complainant was entitled to receive the claim amount and
appropriate compensation from the petitioner and its joint venture partner viz.
Allahabad Bank (respondent No. 2) for the goods stolen from the premises in question.

2. It appears from the materials on record that the respondent Bank, acting as an intermediary
","Universal Sompo General Insurance appealed against an order by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) affirming the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's (SCDRC) decision. The dispute arose after Suresh Chand Jain's premises were burglarized and subsequently caught fire, leading to claims under fire and burglary insurance policies issued through Allahabad Bank. The insurance company repudiated the theft claim and closed the fire claim due to non-submission of documents, prompting Jain to file a consumer complaint.","The court analyzed Section 21(a) and Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and corresponding sections of the 2019 Act, to determine the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. It clarified that the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is limited to orders passed by the NCDRC in its original jurisdiction, not in its appellate or revisional jurisdiction. The court also discussed the scope and grant of special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution, emphasizing that it is exercised sparingly and only in special and extraordinary situations where substantial injustice has occurred.","The Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition, holding that it should not entertain an appeal directly against the order passed by the NCDRC in its appellate jurisdiction and suggested the petitioner avail the remedy of filing a writ petition under Article 226 or a petition invoking supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227."

Rastogi, J.
CIVIL APPEAL NO(S).5352−5353 OF 2007 Reason:
1. The assail in the present appeals by special leave is to judgment and order passed
by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter “National
Commission”) dated 3rd December, 2004, whereby the National Commission, while
reversing the finding of the Gujarat State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(hereinafter “State Commission”), regarding maintainability of the complaint filed at
the instance of the respondent under the Consumer Protectio","National Insurance Co. Ltd. appealed against the National Commission's order, which reversed the State Commission's finding. Harsolia Motors, a dealer in TATA vehicles, had taken out a fire insurance policy and filed a complaint after suffering damage during the Godhra riots, which the insurance company denied. The dispute centers on whether the insurance policy taken by a commercial enterprise constitutes hiring services for a ""commercial purpose"" under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The court considered Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, defining ""consumer"" and the exclusion of services hired for ""commercial purpose."" The appellant cited Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute, arguing that the intent to generate profit determines whether an activity is commercial. The respondent argued that insurance is for indemnification, not profit generation, and that the Act only bars transactions ""for commercial purpose,"" not commercial enterprises from being consumers.",The final outcome of the appeal is not available in the provided document.

1. Common order dated 26.11.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (for short, “the National Commission”) in Revision Petition Nos. 923 of 2011 and 1417
of 2014 is under challenge before this Court. We deem it appropriate to notice the facts separately,
before we deal with the arguments. REVISION PETITION NO. 923/2011
2. This petition was filed by the respondent Insurance Company before the National Commission
challenging order dated 23.12.2010 passed by Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (for short “the State Commission”) in Appeal No. 1792/09. 17:18:03 IST Reason:
It was an appeal against an order dated 11.9.2009 passed by the District Civil Appeal
Nos. 2769-2770 of 2023 Consumer Disput","Om Prakash Ahuja filed a consumer complaint against Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. for repudiating his claims for medical expenses incurred on his wife's treatment for ovarian cancer under a health insurance policy. The insurance company denied the claims, alleging non-disclosure of a pre-existing rheumatic heart disease. The dispute also involves the renewal of the health insurance policy after its initial term.","The judgment discusses the validity of the insurance company's refusal to renew the policy and the admissibility of claims during the renewed period, especially considering an interim order by the National Commission regarding the renewal. The court refers to guidelines issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regarding refusal of renewal based on fraud, moral hazard, or misrepresentation. The judgment also mentions previous Supreme Court cases like Sulbha Prakash Motegaonkar v. LIC, Satwant Kaur Sandhu v. New India Assurance Company Limited, Reliance Life Insurance Company Limited and Another v. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod and Oriental Insurance Company Limited v. Mahendra Construction.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part, upholding the reimbursement of expenses incurred during the initial policy period but denying claims for the period after the initial policy expired, as the renewal was deemed improper by the National Commission."

S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J
1. The appellant Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (hereinafter, “PVVNL”) is aggrieved
by an order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter, “NCLAT”)1 which
rejected its appeal against an order of the National Company Law Tribunal, Allahabad (hereinafter,
“NCLT”/ “Adjudicating Authority”),2 which allowed an application directing the District Magistrate
and Tehsildar, Muzaffarnagar to immediately release property (which was previously attached at the
request of the appellant) in favour of the liquidator of the respondent Raman Ispat Pvt. Ltd.
(hereinafter, “corporate debtor”) for enabling its sale, and after realisation of its value","Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. (PVVNL) appealed against an order directing the release of attached property of Raman Ispat Private Limited (corporate debtor) to its liquidator for sale under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). PVVNL claimed priority over other creditors for electricity dues based on the Electricity Act, 2003, arguing that it has an overriding effect on the IBC. The dispute centers on whether electricity dues should be prioritized over other claims in the liquidation process.","The judgment analyzes the interplay between the Electricity Act, 2003, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically regarding the priority of claims during liquidation. PVVNL argued that Sections 173 and 174 of the Electricity Act grant it priority, while the liquidator contended that the IBC's Section 53 waterfall mechanism governs. The court considered arguments regarding 'security interest' and the overriding effect of special vs. general laws, referencing precedents like Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai v. Indian Oil Corporation and State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd.",Not available in document

appellant herein, the original revisionist has preferred the present appeals.
2. The facts leading to the present appeals in a nutshell are as under:

against the mother of the appellant – original defendant for Date: 2023.02.24

specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 09.05.2012. In the agreement to
sell, the late mother of the appel","P. Shyamala appealed against Gundlur Masthan regarding a specific performance decree related to an agreement to sell a property. The original plaintiff, Masthan, sought specific performance of an agreement to sell against Shyamala's deceased mother, but delayed depositing the balance sale consideration. Shyamala, as the legal heir, sought to rescind the agreement due to the delay.","The court considered Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act regarding extension of time for depositing the balance sale consideration. The court cited V.S. Palanichamy Chettiar Firm v. C. Alagappan, emphasizing that granting specific performance requires equitable considerations and reasonable conduct by the vendee. The court found the delay of 853 days unjustified and insufficient cause shown for the delay.",Not available in document

1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated
14.09.2021 passed by the High Court of Judicature Bombay at Nagpur Bench at Nagpur in Public
Interest Litigation No. 11/2021 and Writ Petition No. 1096 of 2021, by which, the Division Bench of
the High Court has struck down and has declared Rule 3(2)(b), Rule 4(2)(c) and Rule 6(9) of the
Consumer Protection (Qualification for appointment, method of recruitment, procedure of
appointment, term of office, resignation and removal of Pr","The Ministry of Consumer Affairs appealed a judgment by the Bombay High Court which struck down Rules 3(2)(b), 4(2)(c), and 6(9) of the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, deeming them arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. These rules pertained to the qualifications, recruitment, and appointment procedures for Presidents and Members of State and District Consumer Commissions. The grievance was that the rules gave excessive discretion to the selection committee and lacked transparency, potentially leading to unsuitable appointments and frustrating the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act.","The High Court found the challenged rules to be in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution, citing the lack of transparency and excessive discretion granted to the selection committee. The court relied on precedents such as *State of Uttar Pradesh and Others Vs. All Uttar Pradesh Consumer Protection Bar Association* and *Madras Bar Association Vs. Union of India and Another*, emphasizing the need for qualified individuals with legal backgrounds to ensure fair adjudication. The court emphasized that the standards for appointing members of tribunals should be as close as possible to those applicable to the appointment of judges.","The High Court's judgment was appealed.

1) A contract was entered into between the parties for the repair of bathrooms and other allied
works on 02.07.2001. It would appear that time was extended up to 19.01.2002. The
respondent-Contractor submitted final bill on 13.02.2002. It contained a No Claims Certificate. The
said amount claimed by the respondent apparently was not paid immediately. The respondent it
would appear made several reminders regarding the non-payment of the final bill for a CA Nos.
3441-3442/ 2015 period of one year. Following many reminders by the respondent regarding the
non payment of the final bill, according to the respondent, it sent a list of additional claims on
25.02.2003 and in the said letter, claimed that the letter and the Final bill should be considered as
under protest. The respondent signed affidavit dated 2","The Union of India appealed against M/S. Bharat Enterprise regarding a contract for bathroom repairs and allied works. The dispute arose after the contractor submitted a final bill with a 'No Claims Certificate,' later claiming additional amounts under protest due to delayed payment. The core issue revolves around whether the contractor is barred from raising further claims after submitting the final bill with the 'No Claims Certificate'.","The court analyzed clauses 65 and 65A of the contract, focusing on whether the arbitrator exceeded the contract's boundaries by allowing claims not included in the final bill. Precedents like Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v. Annapurna Construction were cited to support the argument that an arbitrator cannot disregard contract provisions. The court also considered the contractor's argument of coercion and duress in issuing the 'No Claims Certificate', referencing sections 15 to 18 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.",Not available in document

What is Partition? ............................................................................................... 16 ii.
Order XX Rule 18 of the CPC","Abdul Rejak Laskar (plaintiff/appellant) sought partition of land he purchased from Mafizur Rahman (defendant/respondent). The dispute arose because the plaintiff was not in possession of the land, leading to rejection of his partition request by the revenue authority. The central grievance revolves around whether a civil court has jurisdiction to order partition when the revenue authority has already refused it due to lack of possession.","The court analyzed Section 154(1)(e) of the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886, which bars civil courts from exercising jurisdiction in cases of claims to imperfect partition, except under specific circumstances. The court interpreted Section 97 of the Regulation, stating that possession is a prerequisite for seeking partition from the revenue authorities. Since the plaintiff lacked possession, the revenue authority's rejection was deemed valid, and the civil court's jurisdiction was barred under Section 154(1)(e).","The appeal was dismissed, upholding the High Court's decision that the civil court lacked jurisdiction to order partition. The judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court was set aside, and the Trial Court's judgment dismissing the plaintiff's suit was affirmed."

The Delhi International Airport Ltd. and others raised a preliminary objection, arguing that AERA, as a quasi-judicial body, cannot appeal against TDSAT's judgment. This case addresses the preliminary issue of whether AERA's appeals under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable.","The judgment analyzes the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act 2008, specifically Sections 13, 17, 18, and 31, to determine if AERA has the right to appeal decisions made by TDSAT. The court examines the functions of AERA, including tariff determination for aeronautical services, and whether these functions are adjudicatory or regulatory in nature. The interpretation of Sections 18 and 31 of the AERA Act is crucial in determining the maintainability of the appeals.",The judgment disposes of the preliminary issue of whether the appeals filed by AERA under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable. The specific outcome (allowed or dismissed) is not stated in the provided text.

1. The Appellant (hereinafter referred to as “Appellant-Company”) is assailing the Order dated
15.09.2023, wherein the High Court of Gujarat dismissed the Criminal Revision Application No. 783
of 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “CRA No. 783 of 2017”) moved under Section 397 read with
Section 401 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “CrPC 1973”) against the
rejection of discharge application moved by the Appellant-
Company. The said application was dismissed by the learned Special Judge (CBI) at Ahmedabad
(hereinafter referred to as “Special Judge”) vide Order dated 19.07.2017.
2. It is alleged by the Central Bureau of (hereinafter refer","Baccarose Perfumes and Beauty Products Pvt. Ltd. appealed against the rejection of its discharge application in a case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The CBI alleged that Baccarose conspired with customs officials to evade Countervailing Duty (CVD) by paying it on the invoice value instead of the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of their cosmetics and toilet preparations, causing a loss to the government exchequer. The core issue revolves around whether Baccarose was required to declare MRP on its goods and whether immunity granted by the Settlement Commission bars prosecution.","The court analyzed Section 32K of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and Section 127H of the Customs Act, 1962, noting their pari materia nature and the explicit bar on prosecution after immunity is granted. The court also examined the scheme of the CrPC 1973, clarifying that mere registration of an FIR does not constitute initiation of proceedings, but rather the submission of a chargesheet under Section 173(2) does. The court cited precedents like H.N. Rishbud v. State (Delhi Admn.) and Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI, New Delhi to support its interpretation of the law regarding investigation, cognizance, and the effect of settlement schemes.","The appeal was allowed. The impugned orders of the High Court and the Special Judge were set aside, and the Appellant-Company was discharged from the offences alleged."

Reason:
Bar Of Indian Lawyers Thr","The case involves appeals against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which held that complaints alleging deficiency in service by advocates are maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The specific factual matrix involves an advocate, M. Mathias, who allegedly failed to deliver funds received on behalf of his client, D.K. Gandhi, leading to a consumer complaint seeking compensation for financial loss and mental agony.","The core issue is whether the services of an advocate fall within the definition of ""service"" under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986/2019. The appellants argued that the Advocates Act, 1961, is a special law governing the legal profession and its disciplinary mechanisms, thus prevailing over the CPA. They also contended that the legal profession is unique, involving duties to the court and peers, and that applying consumer protection law would open floodgates of litigation and create conflicting decisions.",The final outcome of the appeal is not available in the provided document.

This common judgme","Bharti Cellular Limited (now Bharti Airtel Limited) is in dispute with the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax regarding the liability to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Revenue claims that the amount paid to franchisees/distributors under franchise/distributorship agreements is a commission, while Bharti Airtel argues it is not. The case involves cellular mobile telephone service providers.","The court analyzes Section 194-H of the Income Tax Act, 1961, focusing on the definition of 'commission or brokerage' and the relationship between principal and agent as defined by Section 182 of the Contract Act, 1872. The court emphasizes that the obligation to deduct tax at source arises only when a legal principal-agent relationship is established. The court refers to prior judgments to support the interpretation of 'acting on behalf of another person'.",Not available in document

Centr","The case involves a dispute between the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification and M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) concerning the appointment of arbitrators under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The core issue revolves around the independence and impartiality of arbitral tribunals, particularly when one party has dominance in appointing arbitrators. The specific product or service involved is not detailed, but it relates to railway electrification projects.","The court analyzed the interplay between party autonomy and the mandatory principles of equality, independence, and impartiality under the Arbitration Act. It considered Section 12(5) of the Act, which renders a person ineligible for appointment as an arbitrator if their relationship with the parties falls under the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule. The court also examined precedents like Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. and TRF Ltd v.

The appellants, including the Chief Commissioner of Central Goods and Service Tax, are contesting a decision regarding Input Tax Credit (ITC) for goods and services used in the construction of immovable property intended for renting/leasing. The respondents, such as M/s Safari Retreats Private Ltd., argue that denying ITC on these constructions violates Articles 14, 19(1)(g), and 300A of the Constitution of India.","The assessees argued that Section 17(5)(d) violates Article 14 by treating assessees constructing properties for renting the same as those constructing for selling, denying ITC for business expenditure. They contended there's no intelligible differentia for this classification, especially since works contracts are treated as supply of services under CGST. The assessees also argued that denying credit perpetuates the cascading effect of tax, contrary to the CGST Act's objective, and that the terms ""on its own account"" and ""plant or machinery"" are vague.",Not available in document

Order dated 15.11.2023 passed in Criminal Revision Petition No. 1243 of 2023. High Court of
Karnataka at Bengaluru.
3. Vide aforesaid order, the High Court set aside the order dated 10.04.2023 passed by the Board4.
4. Briefly, the facts as available on record are that FIR 5 was registered against the CCL for
commission of offences under sections 376(i), 342 IPC and sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Protection of
Children from Sexual O","This case involves a Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) appealing an order from the High Court of Karnataka. The dispute centers on whether the CCL should be tried as a juvenile by the Juvenile Justice Board or as an adult by the Children's Court, concerning offences under IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The mother of the victim sought to terminate proceedings before the Board and transfer the matter to the Children’s Court.","The arguments revolved around the interpretation of Sections 15, 17, 18, 19, and 101 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, concerning preliminary assessment, procedures of the Board, and appeals. The appellant argued that the Board's order was flawed due to procedural irregularities and timelines not being adhered to, citing precedents like *Balaji Baliram Mupade and Another v. State of Maharashtra and Others*, *Barun Chandra Thakur vs. Master Bholu & Anr.* and *Shilpa Mittal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)*. The respondent argued that the Children's Court could reconsider the matter and that the scope of Section 101(1) and 101(2) is different.",Not available in document

VIKRAM NATH, J.
1. Civil Appeals 2809-2810 of 2024, by the appellant filed under Section 23 of the Consumer
Protection Act, 19861, read with Order XXIV of the Supreme Court Rules, assail the correctness of
the final judgment and order dated 15.09.2023 passed by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission2 in CC No.600/2020 as also the order dated 30th October, 2023 passed on
the Review Application No.335/2023. By the aforesaid orders, the NCDRC allowed the CC
No.600/2020 partly to CPA, 1986 NCDRC the extent that it directed refund of the entire amount
deposited by the Complainant (appellant) (except non-judicial stamp ","Dharmendra Sharma, the appellant, filed a consumer complaint against Agra Development Authority (ADA) regarding a delayed apartment possession and additional demands for payment. Sharma had applied for an apartment in 2011, made payments, but faced delays and demands for extra charges beyond the initial agreement. The core grievance revolves around the validity of the possession offer without a completion certificate and firefighting clearance, and the appropriate date from which interest should be calculated on the deposited amount.","The court considered Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 regarding the limitation period for filing complaints. It also examined precedents concerning the validity of possession offers without necessary completion and firefighting certificates, referencing cases like *Debashis Sinha & Ors. vs. R.N.R. Enterprise* and *Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited vs. Union of India & Ors.* The court also considered the provisions of RERA Act, 2016 and the UP (Promotion of Apartment and Ownership and Maintenance) Act, 2010 regarding the requirement of a completion certificate for a valid offer of possession.",Not available in document

PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.
1. The issue arising in the present appeal relates to enforcement of an arbitral award expressed in
foreign currency. In this context, two questions arise for consideration. First, what is the correct and
appropriate date to determine the foreign exchange rate for converting the award amount expressed
in foreign currency to Indian rupees. Second, what would be the date of such conversion, when the
award debtor deposits some amount before the court during the pendency of proceedings
challenging the award. Two uncertainties have a direct bearing on the question to be answered, the
time lapse between the date of the award and its enforceability- Date: 2024.08.08 17:41:47 IST
Reason:
a local factor","DLF Ltd., an Indian company, and Koncar Generators and Motors Ltd., a Croatian company, were in dispute over a contract for the design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply of generators. An arbitral tribunal awarded Euros 10,93,989 plus interest to Koncar. The core issue is determining the correct date for converting the Euro-denominated arbitral award into Indian Rupees for enforcement.","The Supreme Court considered the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, particularly Sections 34, 48, and 49, along with precedents like Forasol v. Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Renusagar Power Co Ltd v. General Electric Co. The court established twin principles: the date the award becomes enforceable (objections dismissed) is the conversion date, and if an amount is deposited in court pending objections and available for withdrawal, that deposit date is the relevant conversion date for that portion.","The judgment focuses on determining the applicable foreign exchange rate for converting the Euro-denominated arbitral award into Indian Rupees, specifically addressing the deposits made during the pendency of objections. The final outcome regarding the specific conversion rates and amounts payable is detailed within the truncated document and requires further information to fully summarize."

The dispute arose from purchase orders placed by FCIL for HDPE bags, with Coromandal Sacks alleging discrepancies in pricing, wrongful deductions for liquidated damages and penalties, and losses due to FCIL's refusal to accept ordered bags. Coromandal Sacks filed a civil suit to recover these losses.","The judgment primarily focuses on the applicability of Section 22(1) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, regarding the suspension of legal proceedings against a sick industrial company. The court analyzes whether this suspension extends to civil suits for recovery of money where the debt is not admitted. The judgment also examines the appropriateness of the 24% compound interest rate granted by the High Court on the principal decretal amount.",The appeals were partly allowed by the High Court.

1. These appeals take exception to the separate impugned judgments and orders dated 7th October
2021 and 29th October 2021 passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (for short,
‘the NCLAT’). In Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022, the issue involved is whether the first respondent is a
financial creditor within the meaning of sub-section (7) of Section 5 of the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for short, ‘the IBC’). The corporate debtor, in this case, is M/s. Mount
Shivalik Industries Limited. The impugned judgment respondent is a","Global Credit Capital Limited appealed against a decision that classified Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. as a financial creditor under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The dispute arose from agreements where Sach Marketing deposited security amounts with Mount Shivalik Industries Limited (corporate debtor) to act as a sales promoter for beer, with interest payable on the deposit. The core issue is whether this security deposit constitutes a 'financial debt' or an 'operational debt' under the IBC.","The court analyzed the definitions of 'debt', 'financial debt', and 'operational debt' under Sections 3 and 5 of the IBC. The appellants argued that the security deposit was a condition for providing services and not a financial facility, citing precedents to support their interpretation. The respondents contended that the agreements had the commercial effect of borrowing, satisfying the criteria for a financial debt, and pointed to the corporate debtor's acknowledgement of interest liability.",Not available in document

New Delhi3 passed in Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 867 of 2021 and I.A. No. 2315 of 2021,
whereby the appellant’s appeal against the order of the National Company Law Tribunal, New

                              Order dated 24.11.202","Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) appealed against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) order, which had dismissed GNIDA's appeal against the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) order. The dispute arose from GNIDA's claim as a creditor to M/s. JNC Construction (P) Ltd (Corporate Debtor) undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). GNIDA contested being treated as an operational creditor instead of a financial or secured creditor, arguing it was not informed of Committee of Creditors (COC) meetings and its claim was not properly considered.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), specifically Sections 5(8) defining 'financial debt', 3(30) and 3(31) defining 'secured creditor' and 'security interest', and Section 30(2) concerning the resolution plan. The court also considered Sections 13, 13A, and 14 of the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976, regarding GNIDA's statutory charge over the Corporate Debtor's assets. The NCLAT cited the precedent of *New Okhla Development Authority vs. Anand Sonbhadra* to support the view that a lease doesn't automatically qualify GNIDA as a financial creditor without disbursement for the time value of money.","The appeal preferred by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority was dismissed, upholding the NCLAT's decision."

1. The captioned set of",Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. and other banks appealed against a National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) order that deemed charging interest rates exceeding 30% on credit card holders as an unfair trade practice. The banks argued that determining interest rates is the exclusive domain of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and that the NCDRC lacked jurisdiction due to statutory bars under the Banking Regulation Act.,"The banks contended that Section 21A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, prevents courts from reopening transactions based on excessive interest rates. They argued that the NCDRC encroached upon the RBI's statutory domain, violating the Constitution and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The judgment in Central Bank of India Vs Ravindran was cited to support the argument that RBI directives should be the standard for determining excessive interest.",Not available in document

(appellant), a bio-fuel manufacturer, and M/s Shahaji Bhanudas Bhad (respondent), a supplier of equipment for sugar factories, are in dispute over outstanding payments for work done by the respondent under purchase orders issued by the appellant. The respondent claimed Rs. 18,12,21,452/- was outstanding, leading to invocation of arbitration and proceedings under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The core issue revolves around whether pre-existing disputes existed that would preclude the IBC proceedings.","The judgment primarily focuses on the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, specifically Section 11(6) regarding the appointment of arbitrators, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), particularly Section 9 concerning the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process. The court analyzes whether the application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is for the same relief as an application under Section 9 of the IBC. The court also examines the scope and applicability of Order 23 Rule 1 of the CPC to proceedings other than suits.","The appeal arises from a High Court order allowing a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and appointing an arbitrator. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and proceeded to analyze the issues."

1. In the year 2019, Karikho Kri, an independent candidate, Dr. Mohesh Chai, candidate of the
Bharatiya Janata Party, and Nuney Tayang, candidate of the Indian National Congress, contested
the election to the Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly
Constituency. The election was held on 11.04.2019 and Karikho Kri emerged victorious with 7538
votes, while Dr. Mohesh Chai secured 7383 votes and Nuney Tayang secured 1088 votes.
2. Nuney Tayang filed Election Petition No. 01(AP) of 2019 before the Itanagar Bench of the High
Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, seeking a declaration that the election
of Karikho Kri was void on the grounds mentioned in Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)","This case involves an election dispute in Arunachal Pradesh. Nuney Tayang filed an election petition challenging Karikho Kri's victory, alleging improper acceptance of Kri's nomination due to non-disclosure of assets in his affidavit. The High Court declared Kri's election void, leading to appeals by both Kri and Tayang.","The High Court applied Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i) and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, regarding improper acceptance of nomination and corrupt practices. The court relied on the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the decision in Naveen Kumar vs. Vijay Kumar to determine ownership of vehicles. The High Court interpreted that non-disclosure of assets, even if registered in the names of dependents, constituted a defect of substantial character.",Not available in document

1. “Law is the king of kings, nothing is mightier than law, by whose aid, even the weak may prevail
over the strong.” The power structures of our society are such that the weaker ones often find
themselves exploited and oppressed by those who yield greater power. Land ownership is one such
arena where we see the swords of powerplay being sharpened with continued fraud, deceit, and
greed. While we shall deal with the facts of the present case in SONIA BHASIN detail later, it is a

Ravaria then sold the same land to another party (Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji) in 2010, leading Mishra to file a suit for cancellation of the second sale deed and a permanent injunction. The dispute centers around the validity of the initial sale deed and the subsequent sale of the same property.","The judgment primarily revolves around property law, the validity of sale deeds, and the rights of bona fide purchasers. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, specifically Section 11 regarding the competency of minors to contract, and the Registration Act, 1908, particularly Section 85 concerning the destruction of pending documents, were discussed. The court considered whether the initial sale deed was void due to one of the purchasers being a minor and whether the subsequent purchaser was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the prior transaction.","The initial Trial Court dismissed the suit, but the first Appellate Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiffs. The High Court then overturned the first Appellate Court's decision, reinstating the Trial Court's dismissal; this Supreme Court case is an appeal against that High Court decision."

The dispute centers on whether their activities fall under the definition of 'business auxiliary service' under the Finance Act, 1994.","The court considered Article 246 and 248 of the Constitution, along with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, to determine the Parliament's power to legislate on service tax.

1. The present civil appeal has been filed by the complainant, who is the daughter of the
insured-deceased Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu, who is also the nominee under the subject life
insurance policies of her late father. The appellant is assailing the order dated 22.07.2019 passed by
the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as
“NCDRC”) in Revision Petition No.1268 of 2019.
2. By the impugned order, the NCDRC has allowed the revision petition filed by the
respondent-opposite party, thereby setting aside the orders passed by the District Consumer Forum
and the State Consumer Forum and sustaining the repudiation of the complainant’s claim by the
opposite party insurer-company.
","Maha Kali Sujatha, daughter and nominee of the deceased insured Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu, filed a consumer complaint after Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited repudiated her claim. The repudiation was based on the allegation that the insured suppressed material facts regarding existing life insurance policies from other insurers in his application form. The complainant alleged deficiency of service by the insurance company.","The court considered Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, which governs the repudiation of insurance claims based on misstatements or suppression of facts. The court analyzed the burden of proof on the insurer to demonstrate that the insured made a false statement on a material matter, suppressed facts that were material to disclose, and did so fraudulently. The court also considered the principle of ""uberrimae fidei"" (utmost good faith) in insurance contracts.",Not available in document

                               ","M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance is appealing against Rambha Devi & Ors. The core dispute revolves around whether a person holding a license for a 'Light Motor Vehicle' can drive a 'Transport Vehicle' without a specific endorsement, given the 'Gross Vehicle Weight' does not exceed 7,500 kgs. This involves insurance claims related to motor vehicle accidents.","The court is analyzing Section 2(21), 3 & 10 of the Motor Vehicle Act (MV Act) and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (MV Rules). The central question is the interpretation of 'Light Motor Vehicle' and whether it includes 'Transport Vehicles' under a certain weight. The court is also examining the impact of amendments to the MV Act and conflicting judgments on the matter, specifically addressing whether the Mukund Dewangan(2017) judgment was per incuriam.",Not available in document

2. The basic facts giving ri","M/S Sundew Properties Limited, a developer of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), appealed against the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC)'s order, which was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). The dispute concerns whether Sundew Properties, as a deemed distribution licensee under the Electricity Act, is required to comply with additional financial requirements (infuse additional capital) stipulated by the TSERC to maintain its deemed licensee status. The product/service involved is electricity distribution within the SEZ.","The court analyzed Section 14 of the Electricity Act, 2003, concerning the grant of licenses and the status of deemed licensees, along with the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The court also considered the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (Distribution Licence) Regulations, 2013 and the Distribution of Electricity Licence (Additional Requirements of Capital Adequacy, Creditworthiness and Code of Conduct) Rules, 2005. The central issue was whether the financial requirements under the 2005 Rules applied to deemed licensees, with the appellant arguing they did not, and the respondents arguing they did, citing a precedent in Sesa Sterlite Limited v. Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission.",Not available in document

K.V. Viswanathan, J.
1. The present appeal arises from the judgment dated 30.06.2014 of the Appellate Tribunal for
Electricity (for short the “APTEL”) in Appeal No. 29 of 2013. By the said judgement, the APTEL
dismissed the appeal of the appellant and confirmed the order dated 12.11.2012 of the Punjab State
Electricity Regulatory Commission (for short the “State Commission”), insofar as issue no. 1
discussed therein was concerned. That issue concerned the aspect of Mega Power Policy and the
effect of the Press Release of 01.10.2009. We are only concerned with the said issue in this Appeal.
FACTS OF THE CASE: -
A) Customs Notification No. 21/2002 dated 01.03.2002.
2. To appreciate the issues involved, certain background facts need to be set out. Goods imported for
setting up a M",Nabha Power Limited appealed against Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd's decision regarding the applicability of the Mega Power Policy and the effect of a Press Release dated 01.10.2009. The dispute centers on customs duty exemptions for goods imported for setting up a Mega Power Project. The core issue is whether Nabha Power Limited qualifies for these exemptions under the Mega Power Policy.,"The judgment analyzes the Customs Act, specifically Section 25, and notifications issued thereunder, including Notification No. 21/2002. It also examines the Mega Power Policy of 2006 and a subsequent Press Release modifying it. The court's interpretation focuses on the conditions required to be fulfilled for grant of mega project status and the impact of the Press Release on these conditions.","The appeal was dismissed, confirming the order of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission regarding issue no. 1, which concerned the Mega Power Policy and the effect of the Press Release of 01.10.2009."

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1911 OF 2023
Pawapuri Rice Mills","Pawapuri Rice Mills and other rice millers in Bihar appealed against recovery proceedings initiated by the Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation for alleged non-supply of Custom Milled Rice (CMR) for the procurement year 2011-12. The dispute arose from an agreement where the millers were to mill paddy procured from farmers and deliver a percentage of rice to the Corporation, with disagreements over delivery and acceptance of CMR. The millers contested the legality of the recovery proceedings under the Bihar and Orissa Public Demands Recovery Act, 1914.","The judgment primarily concerns the applicability of the Bihar and Orissa Public Demands Recovery Act, 1914, and its rules, specifically whether the dues claimed by the Civil Supplies Corporation constitute a 'public demand' under Section 3(6) read with Clause 8-A of the Schedule. The High Court initially ruled against the applicability of the Act, finding the relationship between the miller and the Corporation to be contractual and not falling under the purview of public demand. The Supreme Court is examining the correctness of the High Court's decision regarding the applicability of the Act for recovery of dues arising from the agreement.",Not available in document

It examines the historical context of these articles, including Constituent Assembly debates, and reviews precedents concerning their validity and scope. The court delves into the interpretation of 'material resources of the community' under Article 39(b) and its nexus with Article 31C, which provides protection to legislations giving effect to Article 39(b) from challenges under Articles 14 and 19.",The document does not provide the final outcome of the case (whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed).

The Division Bench determined that the relief sought required actions (execution and registration of the sale deed) to occur in Gurgaon, outside the Delhi High Court's jurisdiction. They distinguished the case from Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. Daulat and Another, stating that the present case involved inherent possession rights under Section 55(1) of the Transfer of Property Act, making the proviso to Section 16 CPC inapplicable.","The appeals filed by Vipul Infrastructure Developers Ltd. were allowed, and the plaint was ordered to be returned to Rohit Kochhar for presentation before the appropriate court with territorial jurisdiction."

PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.
1. What are the legal implications of a promotional trailer, popularly known as a ‘promo’, or a teaser
that is circulated before the release of a movie? Does it create any contractual relationship or
obligations akin to it? Is it an unfair trade practice if the contents of the promotional trailer are not
shown in the movie? These questions have arisen in the context of a consumer dispute wherein the
consumer courts have allowed the complaint alleging deficiency of service based on a ‘contractual
obligation’ and ‘unfair trade practice’. For the reasons to follow, we have held that promotional
trailers are unilateral and do not qualify as offers eliciting acc",Yash Raj Films Private Limited appealed against a consumer court decision after Afreen Fatima Zaidi filed a complaint because the movie 'Fan' did not include a song ('Jabra Fan') that was prominently featured in its promotional trailer. Zaidi claimed this omission caused her mental agony and constituted a deficiency in service and unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act. The core issue is whether a promotional trailer creates a contractual obligation to include all its content in the final movie.,"The court analyzed the definitions of 'service' and 'deficiency' under Section 2(1)(o) and 2(1)(g) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, respectively. It held that promotional trailers are unilateral advertisements protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and do not constitute offers that create enforceable contracts. The court determined that the omission of the song did not amount to a 'deficiency of service' or 'unfair trade practice' as defined under the Act.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by Yash Raj Films, overturning the previous consumer court decisions that had favored Afreen Fatima Zaidi."

VIKRAM NATH, J.
1. This is a classic case where wisdom dawned upon the three parties in a commercial arrangement
to settle the dispute amicably, of course, with a little effort by the Court. The three parties, being the
borrower/flat owners, the builder and the Bank – the lender. Under the agreement between the
parties, there were respective obligations on each of the parties to be fulfilled, in which there were
defaults at the en","Akshay Gupta and other flat owners filed consumer complaints against ICICI Bank alleging unfair trade practices and violation of RBI guidelines related to loan recall notices. The dispute arose from a commercial arrangement involving the borrowers/flat owners, the builder (Rajsanket Realty Ltd.), and the bank, where defaults occurred on the part of each party. The appeals were preferred under section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The judgment primarily focuses on recording and enforcing the terms of an amicable settlement reached between the parties, rather than a detailed statutory analysis. Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is mentioned as the basis for the appeals against the NCDRC order. The court facilitated the settlement and ensured compliance with its terms, without explicitly interpreting specific provisions of the Consumer Protection Act or citing precedents.","The appeals were disposed of based on the amicable settlement reached between the parties, with the court ensuring full compliance with the agreed-upon terms, including discounts from the bank, payments from the builder, and deposits from the borrowers. The bank was directed to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to the borrowers."

1. Leave granted.
2. Since the issues raised in all the captioned appeals are same, the parties are also same and the
challenge is also to the self-same judgment and order passed by the High Court those were taken up
for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this common judgment and order.
3. These appeals arise from the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana
at Chandigarh dated 09.09.2022 in Civil Revision No. 6706 of 2019, Civil Revision No. 6952 of
2019, Civil Revision No. 6980 of 2019 and Civil Revision No. 7053 of 2019 respectively by which the
High Court rejected all the four revision applications filed by the original defendants by a common
order and the","Balbir Singh and others filed suits for specific performance of agreements to sell land, which were initially decreed by the trial court but reversed on appeal. The High Court restored the trial court's decrees. The dispute arose when the defendants sought rescission of the contract under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to deposit the balance sale consideration within the originally stipulated 20-day period.","The court considered Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which allows for rescission of contracts for sale of immovable property if the purchaser fails to pay within the decreed period or any extension granted by the court. The court noted that the trial court's decree merged with the High Court's decree in the second appeals, and the High Court did not fix a specific time for payment. The court determined that there was no unreasonable delay on the part of the decree holders in depositing the amount.","The appeals were dismissed, affirming the High Court's judgment and order. The court upheld the executing court's decision to reject the application for rescission of the contract, finding that the decree holders did not fail to honor the conditional decree."

1. Heard.
2. The appellants have approached this Court by way of this appeal seeking a direction upon the
respondents to consider the candidature of the appellants for appointment as Food Safety Officers1,
pursuant to the notification dated 7th October, 2015 issued by the Jharkhand Public Service
Commission2 upon the requisition of the State of Jharkhand.
3. The appellants herein have the qualifications of post-graduation in science with microbiology,
food and technology subjects. They applied for the post of FSO in pursuance of the Advertisement
No. 01/20163 issued by the JPSC wherein the educational qualification for the said post was
stipulated in the terms below: -
Chandra Shekhar Singh vs The State Of Jharkhand on 20 Marc","Chandra Shekhar Singh and others appealed against the State of Jharkhand, challenging their disqualification for the position of Food Safety Officer (FSO). The appellants, possessing post-graduation degrees in relevant science subjects, were deemed ineligible because the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) interpreted the advertisement's requirement of a 'degree' in specific fields to exclude post-graduate degrees. The core dispute revolves around the interpretation of 'degree' in the context of the FSO qualification requirements.","The court analyzed Sections 37, 91, and 94 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act), focusing on the power of the Central Government versus the State Government in prescribing qualifications for FSOs. The appellants argued that the Central Government has the sole authority to define qualifications for FSOs under the FSS Act, and the term 'degree' should include Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees, referencing the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. The court also considered the Food Safety and Standards (First Amendment) Rules, 2022, which clarified that qualifications for FSO include Bachelor's or Master's or Doctorate degrees.",Not available in document

1. The present appeal takes exception to the final judgment and order dated 25th October, 2022
passed in Consumer Complaint No. 262 of 2018, whereby the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission (hereinafter, “NCDRC”) disposed of the Consumer Complaint filed by the
Respondents No. 1 and 2 (hereinafter referred to as, “Complainants” or Reason: “Respondents”)
thereby directing the Appellant to deduct only 10% of the Basic Sale Price (“BSP” for short) towards
cancellation of the Complainants’ Apartment and refund the balance amount along with simple
interest @ 6% per annum from the date of each payment till the date of refund. Aggrieved thereby,
the present appeal has been filed under Section 23 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
2. The facts, in brief,",Godrej Projects Development Limited appealed against the NCDRC's order directing them to deduct only 10% of the Basic Sale Price (BSP) towards cancellation of Anil Karlekar's apartment booking and refund the balance with interest. Karlekar had booked an apartment in Godrej Summit but sought cancellation due to a market recession after the Occupation Certificate was received and possession was offered.,"The court considered the terms of the Apartment Buyer Agreement, specifically clauses related to earnest money deposit (20% of BSP) and forfeiture upon the buyer's default. The appellant cited precedents like Satish Batra v. Sudhir Rawal to justify the forfeiture of earnest money. The respondent cited the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and Haryana regulations limiting forfeiture to 10% of BSP, and precedents arguing that 20% forfeiture was unconscionable.",Not available in document

Independent Sugar Corporation Limited vs Giris","Independent Sugar Corporation Ltd. (INSCO) appealed against the approval of AGI Greenpac's resolution plan for Hindustan National Glass and Industries Ltd. (HNGIL) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). INSCO argued that AGI Greenpac did not have the required Competition Commission of India (CCI) approval at the time of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) approval, violating Section 31(4) of the IBC and potentially leading to an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC) in the glass packaging industry.","The core legal issue revolves around the interpretation of Section 31(4) of the IBC and its proviso, specifically whether CCI approval is mandatory *before* CoC approval of a resolution plan involving a combination under Section 5 of the Competition Act, 2002. The appellant argued for strict compliance with the proviso, while the NCLAT viewed the prior CCI approval as directory, not mandatory, to avoid freezing the CIRP process.

2. The instant appeal impugns the judgment dated 21.05.2018 passed by a Single Judge of the
Kerala High Court (Ernakulam) (High Court), upholding the Family Court’s order dated 09.11.2015
reviving a maintenance petition on the following grounds: (i) paternity and legitimacy are
independent concepts in law; (ii) the Civil Courts did not have jurisdiction to entertain the original
suit; and (iii) since only the Family Court can determine maintenance and legitimacy, the Family
Court could proceed to determine paternity as incidental to the maintenance proceedings.

3. Since the instant appeal arises out of a long-drawn saga, during which multiple ro","Ivan Rathinam and Milan Joseph are involved in a dispute concerning the paternity of Milan Joseph and the related issue of maintenance. Milan Joseph filed a maintenance petition claiming Ivan Rathinam is his biological father, while Ivan Rathinam disputes this claim, citing the legitimacy of Milan Joseph as the son of Raju Kurian, his mother's former husband. The core grievance revolves around whether Ivan Rathinam is obligated to provide maintenance to Milan Joseph.","The judgment primarily revolves around the interpretation of Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, concerning the presumption of legitimacy, and Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, regarding the jurisdiction of Family Courts in matters of maintenance and legitimacy. The court considers precedents like Sharda v. Dharmpal and Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram regarding DNA tests and the conclusiveness of Section 112. The court grapples with the distinction between 'paternity' and 'legitimacy' and the Family Court's jurisdiction to determine paternity incidental to maintenance proceedings.",Not available in document

The appellants' main grievance is the inadequate rate of interest awarded on the delayed payment of the fair value of the shares.,"The appellants argued for a higher interest rate based on Section 34(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, defining a 'commercial transaction' and citing precedents like Union of India v. Tata Chemicals Ltd and Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd v. Coromandal Sacks Private Ltd to support the right to interest as compensation for the time value of money.

2. The present appeal is arising out of order dated 28.05.2019 passed by the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, (for short, “the National Commission”) in First Appeal
No. 1963 of 2018 dismissing the appeal preferred by the present appellant against the order dated
27.09.2018 passed by the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the claim of the present
appellant was rejected on account of suppression of material facts.
3. The facts of the case reveal that the father of the appellant – Ramkaran Sharma had obtained an
insurance policy from the respondent – Exide Life Insurance Co. Ltd. on ","Mahaveer Sharma appealed against Exide Life Insurance Company's repudiation of his deceased father's insurance claim. The insurance company rejected the claim based on the alleged suppression of material facts by the father, specifically the non-disclosure of existing life insurance policies with Life Insurance Corporation of India while applying for the Exide Life policy. The appellant argued that the omission was inadvertent and not material, as the death was accidental and not related to any health issues.","The court analyzed whether the non-disclosure of existing policies constituted a 'material suppression' under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection of Policyholders' Interests) Regulations, 2002, which defines 'material' as important, essential, and relevant information for underwriting the risk. The court considered precedents like Manmohan Nanda v. United India Assurance Company Limited, emphasizing the duty of utmost good faith and the impact of undisclosed facts on a prudent insurer's decision to undertake the risk or fix the premium. The court also considered whether the disclosed policy's sum assured being significantly higher than the undisclosed policies affected the materiality of the non-disclosure.",Not available in document

1. This appeal is under Section 67 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and is directed against the
judgment dated 14th March 2023 passed in Consumer Case No.238 of 2019 by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi1 .
2. The short facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the Reason: 1 hereinafter NCDRC
respondents are a partnership firm that owned the building named ""Madhav Baug"" in the village of
Andheri, Mumbai. The complainants were tenants in two flats on the ground floor in Building-A.
The former decided to demolish this building and construct a new one and, in furtherance thereof,
executed, a Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreement dated 20 th September 2013, allotting
Flat No. 801, carpet area 700 sq. ft. on the 8","Pushpa Jagannath Shetty and others, tenants in a building owned by Sahaj Ankur Realtors, entered into an agreement for alternate accommodation during redevelopment. The realtors failed to provide the agreed-upon flats within the stipulated time, leading to a dispute over allotment of alternative flats or compensation. The complainants filed a consumer complaint seeking allotment of flats or compensation for the delay and non-compliance with the agreement.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 24-A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding the limitation period for filing a complaint. The court held that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) erred in dismissing the complaint as time-barred, considering the ongoing communication and efforts between the parties and the escrow agent to implement the agreement. The court viewed the cause of action as a continuing one, arising not just from the initial breach but also from the subsequent failure to register the already allotted flats.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the NCDRC's order, and restored the complaint to its original status, holding that it was filed within the limitation period. The court directed the NCDRC to decide the matter on its merits, independent of the limitation issue."

The court considers the interplay between the Negotiable Instruments Act and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, specifically focusing on the impact of the moratorium period on ongoing criminal proceedings related to cheque bounce cases.

1. The present appeals challenge two separate orders passed by the High Court of Rajasthan—one by
the Jodhpur Bench dated 29.08.2016 and the other by the Jaipur Bench dated 06.09.2016. The
appeals Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and NEETU KHAJURIA Date: 2025.04.01
18:07:00 IST Reason:
Conditions for Open Access) Regulations, 20161 framed by the Rajasthan Electricity
Regulatory Commission2 in the exercise of its power","Ramayana Ispat Pvt. Ltd. and others appealed against orders of the Rajasthan High Court upholding the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission's (RERC) Regulations of 2016, which imposed restrictions on open access for captive power plants and large electricity consumers. The appellants' main grievance was that the regulations unreasonably restricted their right to open access and penalized them for using it, contrary to the Electricity Act, 2003.","The appellants argued that the RERC lacked jurisdiction to regulate inter-state open access, which falls under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) according to Sections 79(1)(c) and 86(1)(c) of the Electricity Act, 2003. They contended that the RERC's regulations, particularly Regulation 26(7), imposed conditions on inter-state open access that exceeded the State Commission's jurisdiction and infringed upon the powers vested in the CERC. The appellants also argued that the regulations were discriminatory and arbitrary, violating Section 42 of the Electricity Act, 2003.",Not available in document

1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal arises from the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana
at Chandigarh dated 30-8-2022 in Civil Revision Application No.3723/2019 by which the Revision
Application filed by the respondents – herein (original defendants) came to be allowed thereby
setting aside the order passed by the Executing Court directing the defendants to execute the sale
deed in favour of the original plaintiff(s) decree holder on the plaintiff(s) depositing the balance sale
consideration of Rs.5,00,000/- within 15 days from 6-5- 2019.
3. The controversy revolves around in a narrow compass.
4. The appellant before us is the original plaintiff. He instituted ","Ram Lal, the appellant, filed a suit for specific performance of a contract based on an agreement of sale of agricultural land against Jarnail Singh (deceased), the respondent. The suit was decreed in favor of Ram Lal, but the High Court later set aside the Executing Court's order directing the defendants to execute the sale deed, citing a delay in depositing the balance sale consideration. This appeal challenges the High Court's decision.","The primary legal issue revolves around the execution of a decree for specific performance and the timeliness of depositing the balance sale consideration. The High Court considered the delay of approximately three years after the dismissal of the First Appeal as a significant factor, stating that there were no compelling circumstances to justify the delay. The court referenced the principle that time cannot be extended for compliance with a judgment and decree unless there are compelling reasons for non-compliance.",Not available in document

1. The present appeal has been filed against the final judgment and order passed by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission1, wherein multiple penalties (27 in total) were imposed
on the appellant for failing to deliver possession of residential units to homebuyers as per the agreed
timeline. The appellant seeks a stay on the penalty proceedings before the NCDRC, contending that
an NCDRC application under Section 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20162 has been
filed against them, triggering an interim moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC.
2. This Court is called upon to adjudicate whether execution proceedings under Section 27 of the
C","Saranga Anilkumar Aggarwal, a real estate developer, appealed against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) imposing penalties for failing to deliver possession of residential units to homebuyers (Bhavesh Dhirajlal Sheth & Ors.) as per the agreed timeline. The appellant sought a stay on the penalty proceedings, arguing that insolvency proceedings initiated against them under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) triggered an interim moratorium, barring further legal actions. The core dispute revolves around whether execution proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 can be stayed during an interim moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC.","The court considered the interplay between Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, examining whether the interim moratorium under the IBC extends to criminal proceedings initiated under the CP Act for non-compliance with consumer forum orders. The NCDRC relied on precedents like State Bank of India v. V. Ramakrishnan and Ajay Kumar Radheyshyam Goenka v. Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd., emphasizing that the moratorium under Sections 96 and 101 of the IBC is limited to debt-related proceedings and does not shield guarantors from all legal actions, particularly criminal proceedings.",Not available in document

Kunjujamma Mohan* and *DLF Ltd. v. Koncar Generators & Motors Ltd.*, determining that the date of filing the claim petition is the proper date. Regarding the multiplier, the court relied on *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v.

1. The Miscellaneous Applications have been filed jointly by the Supreme Court Bar Association
(SCBA) and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) seeking intervention
in the matter and seeking clarification/ modification of the directions contained in Para 42 of the
Judgment and 12:48:26 IST Reason:
Order dated 20.09.2024 in Criminal Appeal No. 3883- 3884 of 2024. The said Para
42 reads as under: -
“42. In view of the said Notice/Circular dated 30.12.2022 and in furtherance of the
afore-
Supreme Court Bar Association ","The Supreme Court Bar Association and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association filed miscellaneous applications seeking clarification/modification of a previous order (dated 20.09.2024) regarding the marking of appearances of advocates in court proceedings. The associations argued that the directions in the previous order could prejudice the rights of their members, including voting rights, chamber allotment, and eligibility for designation as Senior Advocate. The core issue revolves around the practice of marking appearances for all counsels present, even those assisting, and the potential impact on career progression and association membership criteria.","The court considered the Advocates Act, 1961, the Bar Council of India Rules, and the Supreme Court Rules 2013, particularly Order IV regarding advocates' rights and responsibilities. It examined whether advocates have an absolute right to have their appearances marked and whether the impugned directions infringe upon their legal, fundamental, or statutory rights. The court referenced Article 145 of the Constitution, empowering the Supreme Court to regulate practice and procedure, and considered precedents like Indira Jaising vs. Supreme Court of India and Gopal Jha vs. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.","The court allowed the Applicants-Associations to make their submissions, without being technical about their locus standi to intervene and to file these Miscellaneous Applications in the disposed of matter. The final outcome regarding the modification/clarification of the original order is not explicitly stated in this excerpt, but the court is considering the submissions and arguments presented by the associations."

1. The question which arises in these two appeals for our determination","The Central Bank of India appealed against an order by the NCDRC that found them deficient in service for wrongly reporting M/s Ad Bureau Advertising Pvt. Ltd. as a defaulter to CIBIL, despite a one-time settlement and no-dues certificate. Ad Bureau had taken a project loan from the bank for post-production of a movie and claimed the wrongful reporting led to loss of business. The central question is whether a borrower of a project loan falls under the definition of 'Consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.","The court analyzed Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which excludes those availing services for commercial purposes from the definition of 'consumer,' subject to an exception for self-employment. The court cited National Insurance Company Limited vs. Harsolia Motors & Ors. (2023) 8 SCC 362 & Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust vs. Unique Shanti Developers, (2020) 2 SCC 265. The court determined that despite Ad Bureau's claim of self-branding, the dominant purpose of the loan was commercial, making them not a 'consumer' under the Act.","The document is truncated and does not contain the final decision. Therefore, the outcome of the appeal is Not available in document."

1. Leave granted.
2. Heard learned counsels appearing for the parties. In the present appeal, the order dated
29.01.2024 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench at Nagpur in Writ
Petition No. 5052 of 2022, whereby the Writ Petition came to be allowed, and order dated
27.07.2022 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (herein after referred
to as “NCDRC” in short) in Appeal No. 796 of 2019 came to be quashed, is being questioned. The
parties are referred to as per their rank in the High Court.
3. The fa","The Chief Officer, Nagpur Housing and Area Development Board (MHADA) appealed against Manohar Burde regarding a delay in delivering possession of a 3 BHK flat and demands for additional amounts. Burde alleged deficiency in service and unfair trade practices due to the delayed possession and additional payment demands for the flat he booked in 2009.","The court considered precedents regarding reasonable interest on refunds for delayed possession, specifically citing 'Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank'. It distinguished the case from 'Rohit Chaudhary and another v. Vipul Ltd.' as that case involved commercial property, while this case concerned a residential flat. The court found the NCDRC's award of 9% interest to be fair and reasonable, deeming the High Court's 15% interest excessive.","The appeal was partly allowed; the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order and restored the NCDRC's order of 9% interest on the refund, and reduced the compensation amount from Rs. 10,00,000/- to Rs. 7,50,000/-."

CONSIDERATION..............................................................11 D.
ANALYSIS........................................................","The Cosmos Co-operative Bank Ltd. appealed a High Court judgment that favored Central Bank of India in a dispute over which bank had the first charge on a flat mortgaged by borrowers who defaulted on their loans. The original borrowers availed a loan from Central Bank of India using an unregistered agreement of sale as security, and later the Cosmos Bank also claimed a mortgage on the same property. The core dispute revolves around the validity and priority of the mortgages created in favor of the two banks.","The judgment primarily focuses on the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, specifically concerning the creation and nature of equitable mortgages through the deposit of title deeds. The court analyzes the distinction between mortgages under English law and the Transfer of Property Act, examining whether the Central Bank of India validly created a mortgage based on the unregistered agreement of sale and the subsequent deposit of title deeds. The court also considers whether the Cosmos Bank's mortgage was valid given the flat was already subject to court receivership.","Leave was granted, and the appeal was allowed, setting aside the judgments of the High Court and DRAT. The Supreme Court held that the Central Bank of India did not have a valid mortgage and that the Cosmos Bank had a valid mortgage."

2. The present appeal is filed by the State of Jharkhand and others, against the final order dated
21.08.2023 passed by the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi1 in Writ Petition (Cr.) No. 318 of
2023, whereby the High Court quashed the order / memo dated 17.05.2023 issued by the Inspector
General of Prisons, Ranchi, Jharkhand, making intra-State transfer of the respondent herein from
Lok Hereinafter shortly referred to as “the High Court” Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Central Jail,
Hazaribagh, to Central Jail, Dumka, within the State of Jharkhand.
3. It is the words of Fyodor Dostoevsky, “The degree of civilization in a so","The State of Jharkhand appealed against a High Court order that quashed the Inspector General of Prisons' memo transferring Vikash Tiwary, a convicted gangster, from Hazaribagh Central Jail to Dumka Central Jail. The transfer was based on concerns of gang war and insufficient vigilance. The respondent challenged the transfer, citing violation of natural justice and potential prejudice to his defense in other pending cases.","The judgment analyzes Section 29 of the Prisoners Act, 1900 r/w Rule 770(b) of the State Jail Manual, which empowers the Inspector General of Prisons to pass intra-State jail transfer orders based on sufficient grounds. The court also considers precedents regarding the rights of prisoners, particularly undertrials, and the potential impact of transfers on their ability to defend themselves. The appellant cited Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan to justify the transfer order.",Not available in document

Reason:
","The Union of India appealed against orders of the High Court of Sikkim in writ petitions filed by Future Gaming Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and other respondent-assessees. The dispute concerns the levy of service tax on the sale of paper and online lottery tickets organized by the Government of Sikkim, with the assessees challenging amendments to the Finance Act, 1994, from 2012 onwards.","The High Court examined the constitutional validity of levying service tax on lotteries, considering whether it falls under the Union's power to levy service tax or the State's power to tax betting and gambling. The court applied the principle of pith and substance, concluding that the power to tax lotteries lies exclusively with the State Legislature under Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, thus excluding Parliament's authority under its residuary power.","The High Court allowed the writ petitions filed by the respondent-assessees, effectively ruling against the Union of India's levy of service tax on lotteries. Further details of the specific relief granted are Not available in document."

order dated 02.08.2022 of the Single Judge of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Writ Petition

by the Collector, District Chhatarpur in Case No. 91/Appeal/2021-22 and the judgment dated
27.09.2021 passed by the Sub- Divisional Magistrate and Chairman, Chhatarpur in Case No.
98/B-121/2021-22, allowing the application filed by the Appellant herein under Sect","Urmila Dixit, a senior citizen, sought to invalidate a Gift Deed transferring property to her son, Sunil Sharan Dixit, under Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, alleging neglect and lack of maintenance after the transfer. The dispute centers around whether the Gift Deed was conditional on the son providing basic amenities and physical needs to his mother. The mother claims a promissory note (vachan patra) existed stating the son would care for her, which the son disputes.","The Supreme Court analyzed Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, emphasizing its beneficial nature and the need for liberal interpretation to protect senior citizens' rights. The court cited precedents like Brahmpal v. National Insurance Company and K.H. Nazar v. Mathew K. Jacob to support the principle of purposive construction of beneficial legislation. The court considered whether the transfer of property was conditional on the transferee providing basic amenities and physical needs to the transferor, as required by Section 23.",Not available in document

CHANDRESH Leave granted. Heard all the parties ","The case involves appeals against orders of the Madras High Court related to pollution caused by tanneries in Vellore District, Tamil Nadu, specifically concerning the discharge of untreated effluents into the Palar River. The Vellore District Environment Monitoring Committee and All India Skin and Hide Tanners and Merchants Association (AISHTMA) are the primary parties involved, disputing the assessment and payment of compensation for ecological damage and individual suffering caused by the tanneries. The core issue revolves around the environmental degradation caused by the tanning industry and the resulting impact on water resources and public health.","The judgment refers to the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, specifically Section 3(3) regarding the constitution of an authority to deal with pollution. It also mentions the application of the ""precautionary principle"" and the ""polluter pays"" principle, established in the Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum case. The court analyzes the liability of the tanneries to pay compensation for past pollution and the need for sustainable development, balancing economic interests with environmental protection.","The document is an incomplete judgment and does not contain the final outcome or specific directives.
